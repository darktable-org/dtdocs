The “mask opacity” slider allows you to readjust the mask opacity to compensate. If the mask opacity is decreased (negative slider values) less opaque parts are affected more strongly. Conversely, if the mask opacity is increased (positive slider values) more opaque parts are affected more strongly. As a consequence, completely opaque portions of the mask always remain opaque and completely transparent portions always remain transparent. This is to ensure that regions that have been fully excluded from or included in a module's effect (by setting the mask's opacity to 0% or 100%) remain fully excluded or included.\n"

The amount of tone adjustment is calculated based on this luminance value, and then this same adjustment is applied to all three of the RGB channels. Different luminance estimators can affect the contrast in different parts of the image, depending on the characteristics of that image. The user can therefore choose the estimator that provides the best results for the given image.

msgid "Channel mixing is a process that defines a boosting/muting factor for each channel as a ratio of all the original channels. Instead of entering a single flat correction that ties the output value of a channel to its input value (for example, `R_output = R_input × correction`), the correction to each channel is dependent on the input of _all_ of the channels for each pixel (for example, `R_output = R_input × R_correction + G_input × G_correction + B_input × B_correction`). Thus a pixel's channels contribute to each other (a process known as \"cross-talk\") which is equivalent to rotating the primary colors of the color space in 3D. This is, in effect, digital simulation of physical color filters.\n"

Also, since RGB tristimulus does not decouple luminance and chrominance, but is an additive lighting setup, the \"G\" channel is more strongly tied to human luminance perception than the \"R\" and \"B\" ones. All pixels have a non-zero G channel, which implies that any correction to the G channel is likely to affect all pixels.\n"

If you can see unexposed film stock around the edges of your image, ensure that these areas are excluded from the drawn rectangle when calculating the _paper black_ setting. Paper black represents the density of the blackest silver-halide crystal available on the virtual paper.

If you would like an image to pass to the next review phase, press 2 to give it a 2 star rating. Any images that no longer have a 1 star rating will automatically disappear from view. Continue in this manner until no more images remain visible in the lighttable view.\n"

"4. Alter the lighttable view to only show images with 3 stars. Perform quick edits and experiments on those images in the [darkroom view](../../darkroom/_index.md) to decide if they are worthy of further effort. If you are happy with the results of those edits, promote that image to a 4 star rating for final editing.\n"

Unfortunately, there is no way to find out what the resource limits are, so darktable needs to guess. The default value of 25 is quite conservative. You might want to see if higher values like 100 give better OpenCL performance. If your driver runs out of free handles you will experience failing OpenCL kernels with error code `-5 (CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES)` or even crashes or system freezes. Reduce the number again if that happens. A value of 0 will block darktable from using any event handles. This will prevent darktable from properly monitoring the success of your OpenCL kernels but saves some driver overhead. The consequence is that any failures will likely lead to garbled output without darktable noticing. This is only recommended if you know for sure that your system runs rock-solid.

In this case darktable might in fact save some time when module parameters have changed, as it can go back to some cached intermediate state and reprocess only part of the pixelpipe. In many cases this parameter should be set to \"active module\" (the default), which will only cache the input of the currently focused module.\n"

": In an ideal case you will keep your GPU busy at 100% when reprocessing the pixelpipe. That's good. On the other hand your GPU may also be needed to do regular GUI updates. It might happen that there is no sufficient time left for this task. The consequence would by a jerky reaction of your GUI on panning, zooming or when moving sliders. To resolve this issue darktable can add small naps into its pixelpipe processing to have the GPU catch some breath and perform GUI related activities. The opencl\\_micro\\_nap parameter controls the duration of these naps in microseconds. You will need to experiment in order to find an optimum value for your system. Values of 0, 100, 500 and 1000 are good starting points to try. The default is 1000.\n"

On some devices (namely AMD) direct memory transfers to and from an arbitrary host memory region may give a huge performance penalty. This is especially noticeable when exporting large images. Setting this configuration parameter to TRUE tells darktable to use a special kind of intermediate buffer for host-device data transfers. On some devices this can speed up exporting of large files by a factor of 2 to 3. NVIDIA devices and drivers seem to have a more efficient memory transfer technique even for arbitrary memory regions. As they may not show any performance gain and even may produce garbled output, opencl\\_use\\_pinned\\_memory should be left at its default FALSE for those devices.\n"

However, due to the use of an integer format (which implies rounding errors) they had to apply a \"gamma\" (essentially a transfer function applying a power 1/2.2 or 1/2.4 to encode the RGB values) and increase the bit-depth in the low-lights in order to reduce rounding errors there (humans are very sensitive to low-light details). The 8 bit integer formats are also technically limited to the 0-255 range. Anything outside of this range overflows and is clipped to the nearest bound.\n"

Most of the image-processing algorithms used in these workflows have been tuned around these assumptions.

These possibilities enable what we call a \"scene-referred\" workflow, in which pixels can retain their original radiometric relationships along almost the entire processing pipe. In scene-referred workflow, pixels are prepared for display only at the last stage of the pipeline, in the display transform. This means that the RGB values of the pixels are kept proportional to the intensity of the light emission recorded by the camera on the scene, enabling accurate alpha compositing and optical filter emulations, while also scaling to any dynamic range through the same algorithm (SDR as well as HDR).\n"

In a scene-referred workflow, white and black values are fluid and adapted to the output medium. It is advised that users anchor middle-gray (which will be preserved as-is for any output medium) and let the view transform (_filmic_) dilate or contract the dynamic range around that point. Because 10 bit HDR white is 4 times as bright as 8 bit SDR white, any rigid definition of \"white\" becomes irrelevant.

If you have a 20MPx image then, for precision reasons, darktable will store this internally as a 4 x 32-bit floating point cell for each pixel. Each full image of this size will therefore need about 300MB of memory. As we want to process the image, we will at least need two buffers for each module  – one for input and one for output. If we have a more complex module, its algorithm might additionally require several intermediate buffers of the same size. Without further optimization, anything between 600MB and 3GB would be needed merely to store and process image data. On top of that we have darktable's code segment, the code and data of all dynamically linked system libraries, and not to forget, further buffers where darktable stores intermediate images for quick access during interactive work (mip map cache). \n"

If such a program allocates 5 times 300MB at a time and frees it again, that memory should normally be available for one big 1.5GB allocation afterwards. However this is often not the case. The system's memory allocator may no longer see this area as one contiguous 1.5GB block but as a row of separate 300MB areas. If there is no other free area of 1.5GB available, a subsequent allocation would fail. During a program run this mechanism will take away more and more of the larger memory blocks in favor of smaller ones. darktable's mip map cache allocates several small memory blocks per thumbnail, so this problem is even bigger. For this reason, as of darktable 2.0, 32-bit support is soft-deprecated.\n"

On some older boards you need to activate the \"memory mapping\" BIOS option in order to have all physically installed memory enabled. In addition if you are on a 32-bit OS you will probably need a kernel version that has “Physical Address Extension” (PAE) enabled. This is often but not always the case for Linux. Many distributions deliver different kernels, some with and some without PAE activated; you need to choose the right one. To check if the system is setup correctly, use the command “free” in a terminal and examine the output. If the output reports less RAM than you have installed, you have an issue needing correction; for example you have 4GB on your board, but your kernel is only seeing 3GB or less. You should consult your BIOS manual and the information about your Linux variant for further help.\n"

The [BC Manager tool](https://mountainutilities.eu/bcmanager) (available for Windows and MacOS) can be used to configure them. The easiest thing to do is to reset all encoders and buttons to their simplest settings, which can be done (for the BCR2000) using [this file](https://github.com/dterrahe/darktable/files/6539400/bcr2000.all.buttons.and.encoders.zip). You can send it to the machine with BC Manager or (under Linux) with amidi. There's also a global setting called \"Deadtime\" that determines how long the BCR ignores arriving messages after sending out updates. This is to avoid feedback loops, but for darktable it means that it blocks the adjustments sent back immediately after each rotor move. So Deadtime needs to be set to 0.\n"

msgid "Once configured in this way, button and rotor lights should all work. The top row of rotors (or the only row for the BCF2000) support different light patterns (like the X-Touch Midi, with some extra options and it has 15 instead of 13 leds). However, configuring these is more complicated, and not yet implemented. It also seems to be slower, so may not be doable in real-time for each update (like it is done for the X-touch). So at the moment only the 12-dot pattern is used. For rotors linked to drop-down lists, just like on the X-touch the rotor, the light goes round twice; for the first 15 options only one light goes on, for the second 15 options, two adjacent lights will be on.\n"
