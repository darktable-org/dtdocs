The chromatic adaptation may also push other valid colors out of gamut, at the same time pushing any already out-of-gamut colors even further out of gamut. _Gamut compression_ uses a perceptual, non-destructive, method to attempt to compress the saturation while preserving the luminance as-is and the hue as close as possible, in order to fit the whole image into the gamut of the pipeline working color space.

For scenes dominated by dark tones, it may over-expose the image and end up clipping the highlights.

The [_shadows and highlights_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/shadows-and-highlights.md) module helps bring these details back into visible tonal values. Structural details in fully blown-out highlights, by nature of the digital sensor, can not be recovered. However, you can correct unfavorable color casts in these areas with the [_highlight reconstruction_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/highlight-reconstruction.md) module. The [_color reconstruction_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/color-reconstruction.md) module is able to fill overexposed areas with suitable colors based on their surroundings. The [_filmic rgb_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/filmic-rgb.md) module also offers highlight reconstruction, but be sure to disable [_base curve_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/base-curve.md) first.\n"

"adjusting tonal values\n"
": Almost every workflow is likely to include adjusting the image's tonal range and darktable offers several modules to assist with this. The most basic is the [_contrast brightness saturation_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-brightness-saturation.md) module. In the [_tone curve_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/tone-curve.md) module, tonal values are adjusted by constructing a curve. The [_levels_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/levels.md) and [_rgb levels_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/rgb-levels.md) modules offer a concise interface, with three markers in a histogram.

If you have a 20MPx image then, for precision reasons, darktable will store this internally as a 4 x 32-bit floating point cell for each pixel. Each full image of this size will therefore need about 300MB of memory. As we want to process the image, we will at least need two buffers for each module  – one for input and one for output. If we have a more complex module, its algorithm might additionally require several intermediate buffers of the same size. Without further optimization, anything between 600MB and 3GB would be needed merely to store and process image data. On top of that we have darktable's code segment, the code and data of all dynamically linked system libraries, and not to forget, further buffers where darktable stores intermediate images for quick access during interactive work (mip map cache). \n"

If such a program allocates 5 times 300MB at a time and frees it again, that memory should normally be available for one big 1.5GB allocation afterwards. However this is often not the case. The system's memory allocator may no longer see this area as one contiguous 1.5GB block but as a row of separate 300MB areas. If there is no other free area of 1.5GB available, a subsequent allocation would fail. During a program run this mechanism will take away more and more of the larger memory blocks in favor of smaller ones. darktable's mip map cache allocates several small memory blocks per thumbnail, so this problem is even bigger.

Many distributions deliver different kernels, some with and some without PAE activated; you need to choose the right one. To check if the system is setup correctly, use the command “free” in a terminal and examine the output. If the output reports less RAM than you have installed, you have an issue needing correction; for example you have 4GB on your board, but your kernel is only seeing 3GB or less. You should consult your BIOS manual and the information about your Linux variant for further help.\n"

These applications processed images encoded with 8 bit unsigned integers because it was more memory and computationally efficient. However, due to the use of an integer format (which implies rounding errors) they had to apply a \"gamma\" (essentially a transfer function applying a power 1/2.2 or 1/2.4 to encode the RGB values) and increase the bit-depth in the low-lights in order to reduce rounding errors there (humans are very sensitive to low-light details). The 8 bit integer formats are also technically limited to the 0-255 range. Anything outside of this range overflows and is clipped to the nearest bound.\n"

Most of the image-processing algorithms used in these workflows have been tuned around these assumptions.

These possibilities enable what we call a \"scene-referred\" workflow, in which pixels can retain their original radiometric relationships along almost the entire processing pipe. In scene-referred workflow, pixels are prepared for display only at the last stage of the pipeline, in the display transform. This means that the RGB values of the pixels are kept proportional to the intensity of the light emission recorded by the camera on the scene, enabling accurate alpha compositing and optical filter emulations, while also scaling to any dynamic range through the same algorithm (SDR as well as HDR).\n"

In a display-referred workflow, it is customary to anchor the white value and let tone adjustments revolve around that point, trying to maximize brightness while avoiding clipping. In a scene-referred workflow, white and black values are fluid and adapted to the output medium. It is advised that users anchor middle-grey (which will be preserved as-is for any output medium) and let the view transform (_filmic_) dilate or contract the dynamic range around that point. Because 10 bit HDR white is 4 times as bright as 8 bit SDR white, any rigid definition of \"white\" becomes irrelevant.

If you experience OpenCL errors like failing kernels, set the parameter to FALSE. darktable will then interrupt after each module so that you can more easily isolate the problem.

"opencl\\_number\\_event\\_handles\n"
": Event handles are used so that darktable can monitor the success/failure of kernels and profiling info even if the pixelpipe is executed asynchronously. The number of event handles is a limited resource of your OpenCL driver. For sure they can be recycled but there is a limited number that can be used at the same time. Unfortunately, there is no way to find out what the resource limits are, so darktable needs to guess. The default value of 25 is quite conservative. You might want to see if higher values like 100 give better OpenCL performance. If your driver runs out of free handles you will experience failing OpenCL kernels with error code `-5 (CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES)` or even crashes or system freezes. Reduce the number again if that happens. A value of 0 will block darktable from using any event handles. This will prevent darktable from properly monitoring the success of your OpenCL kernels but saves some driver overhead. The consequence is that any failures will likely lead to garbled output without darktable taking notice. This is only recommended if you know for sure that your system runs rock-solid. You can also set this parameter to -1, which means that darktable assumes no restriction in the number of event handles. This is not recommended.\n"

To resolve this issue darktable can add small naps into its pixelpipe processing to have the GPU catch some breath and perform GUI related activities. The opencl\\_micro\\_nap parameter controls the duration of these naps in microseconds. You will need to experiment in order to find an optimum value for your system.

Setting this configuration parameter to TRUE tells darktable to use a special kind of intermediate buffer for host-device data transfers.

If that check passes, darktable tries to setup its OpenCL environment: a processing context needs to be initialized, a calculation pipeline to be started, OpenCL source code files (extension is `.cl`) needs to be read and compiled and the included routines (called OpenCL kernels) need to be prepared for darktable's modules.
