It is derived from the display transform of the same name, used in the Blender 3D modeler by T. J. Sobotka, Eary_Chow, Sakari Kapanen and others.\nModules placed before AgX in the pipeline operate in scene-referred space. Modules after AgX work in display-referred space.\nYou can automatically enable AgX in new images by setting the value of preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults to \u0026lsquo;scene-referred (AgX)\u0026rsquo;.\n🔗primaries The \u0026ldquo;primaries\u0026rdquo; are the defining feature of AgX and the core of how it handles color. They determine the basic color appearance of the image before the tone mapping curve is applied. For precise definitions of the color terms used in this section, please refer to darktable\u0026rsquo;s color dimensions.\nThe core challenge in fitting a scene\u0026rsquo;s wide dynamic range into a display\u0026rsquo;s narrower range is managing color across the entire tonal scale. Without tone mapping, transitions would be abrupt, and lead to color distortions:\nA simple per-channel curve often causes colorful objects to shift to pure, unnatural-looking primary or secondary colors as their intensity changes \u0026ndash; an effect sometimes called the \u0026ldquo;Notorious 6\u0026rdquo;:\nThe primaries controls in AgX work to prevent this by building a custom color space for the tone curve. By adjusting the primaries before the curve is applied, AgX creates a more graceful \u0026ldquo;path to white,\u0026rdquo; allowing colors to desaturate and shift hue in a way that looks more natural and believable. This process influences the color rendering across the entire tonal range to create a cohesive final image:\n🔗usage Please take note of the following guidelines while using this module within your workflow:\nonly use one display transform Never use AgX together with another display transform module (i.e. sigmoid, filmic rgb or base curve). adjust for the mid-tones first By default, the module preserves middle gray. Before using AgX, you should first use the exposure module to adjust the mid-tones to your liking. A recommended workflow for using this module is provided at the end of this page.\n🔗module controls The module\u0026rsquo;s controls are divided into three categories:\nTone mapping controls (input range and the curve) Post tone-mapping adjustments (\u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo;) Color-related controls (primaries) Throughout this module\u0026rsquo;s documentation, references will be made to other tone mappers, namely filmic rgb and sigmoid. This is to support users already familiar with those modules, however, familiarity with these modules is not required to use AgX.\nDue to the complex nature of this module, related controls are grouped together in collapsible sections, and the controls are distributed over two tabs.\n🔗the settings tab The settings tab holds the most commonly-used controls.\n🔗input exposure range This section provides controls similar to those of the filmic rgb module, allowing you to set the black and white points. The selected exposure range will then be projected into the [0, 1] range using a logarithmic transformation. This means that each 1 EV stop of dynamic range corresponds to an equal distance along the curve\u0026rsquo;s horizontal axis. The mid-gray point is situated proportionally on this axis between the selected extremes. After this initial projection, the data will be further processed by the curve (below).\nwhite relative exposure Set the white point. Any value above this will be clipped to 1. Use the picker to automatically set this value. black relative exposure Set the black point. Any value below this will be clipped to 0. Use the picker to automatically set this value. dynamic range scaling Apply a safety margin when using pickers to select the white and black relative exposure. auto tune levels Select the auto tune picker icon to set both the white and black relative exposures at the same time (same as clicking both pickers above). The read exposure (camera icon) button does not analyze the contents of the image, like the pickers do. Instead, it estimates the black and white relative exposures based on the settings in the exposure module. If there are several instances of exposure, the button will read the settings from the first enabled, unmasked instance. If all instances are masked, the first instance will be used. Using the button only makes sense if the input to AgX is actually influenced by the exposure module \u0026ndash; that is, if the exposure module comes before AgX in the pipeline (which is normally the case). This allows you to take into account any in-camera exposure compensation, in-camera highlight preservation (if supported by darktable), and manual adjustments. The mechanism is similar to that used by filmic rgb, but is not applied automatically. 🔗basic curve parameters In the following discussion, the parts of the tone curve are identified as follows:\nThe pivot is the point on the curve around which contrast is adjusted (the point of highest contrast) The shoulder is the higher bend of the curve (the highlights) The toe is the lower bend of the curve (the shadows) The contrast is the slope of the curve (steeper curve = higher contrast) If you do not understand these terms from the definitions, it may be helpful to show the curve while adjusting the related controls and observe the effect.\npivot relative exposure Sets the input value of the pivot point (the point in the tonal range where the contrast will be highest), in EV relative to mid-gray. Since contrast is normally highest around the pivot, this slider allows you to choose which part of the input tonal range should have the most contrast. The corresponding color picker adjusts only this slider, but not pivot target output (below). You may be tempted to use it as a brightness control (moving the pivot towards black, without modifying its output value, will brighten the image, while moving it towards white will darken the image), but the pivot target output is better suited for that, as it directly influences brightness, without changing the point of highest contrast. When adjusting the black/white relative exposure values, the pivot relative exposure will be maintained for as long as possible. This will cause it to move along the x-axis, as the preserved quantity is the exposure value relative to mid-gray, and its position on the x-axis depends on the endpoints of that axis (the black and white relative exposure values). If an adjustment would cause the pivot input to fall outside the exposure boundaries, it will be forced inside the available range.\npivot target output Sets the target output linear value (power) for the tone selected by the pivot\u0026rsquo;s input. The value is indicated on the y-axis of the curve. Note that the scale of the y-axis is not uniform, and depends on the curve y gamma, described in the section advanced curve parameters. The corresponding color picker adjusts both pivot relative exposure (the point of highest contrast) and pivot target output, attempting to preserve the average brightness of the selected region. For more predictable results, you are advised to use the color pickers on uniform areas, as sudden tonal transitions in the selected area will cause the average values to change drastically, leading to fluctuations in both pivot input and output.\ncontrast Sets the slope of the curve at the pivot point. This value is scaled internally to maintain a consistent final (linear) output contrast, compensating for changes to both the dynamic range and the curve y gamma setting. shoulder power / toe power These sliders determine how fast the contrast drops as the curve approaches black or white. Higher values result in a sharper bend, maintaining contrast for longer before a more abrupt roll-off. If the overall contrast is not sufficient to reach the black and/or white point, either or both ends of the curve may become \u0026ldquo;inverted,\u0026rdquo; rendering these controls ineffective. Should this occur, a warning icon will appear next to the affected slider(s). Hovering over the warning provides a tooltip with suggested actions, and, if the show curve section is expanded (below), the affected part of the curve will be highlighted in yellow. 🔗show curve Expand the show curve section to display a plot of the curve. This can be a useful tool to learn about curve behavior by observing the effect of related controls, or when investigating issues such as loss of detail or \u0026ldquo;curve inversion\u0026rdquo; (see the toe power / shoulder power control above). The plot is not interactive \u0026ndash; it simply illustrates the effect of the sliders.\nThe x-axis shows the selected input exposure range, measured in EV, with all values relative to mid-gray (indicated by the 0 EV mark).\nThe y-axis shows the linear output value, with 18% representing mid-gray. The scaling of the y-axis is not linear \u0026ndash; horizontal grid lines help visualize this non-linearity. The degree of non-linearity is governed by a gamma value (default: 2.2). More information on the gamma is provided in the description of the advanced curve parameters.\nThe curve has 5 important points:\nThe black and white points are at the left and right edges of the graph, respectively; their final linear output values can be controlled by the target black and target white sliders (see advanced curve parameters). The pivot is the point around which the curve is built, indicated by a dot. By default, it maps mid-gray to mid-gray. You may move this point to match your main subject using the provided picker. The toe and shoulder starting points define where the curve transitions from a linear section to the compressed toe (shadows) and shoulder (highlights). By default, these are set to the pivot point. 🔗advanced curve parameters shoulder start Defines the point where the linear portion of the curve ends and the shoulder begins. Keeping the value at 0% allows the smooth transition to start at the pivot. Higher values push the transition point up towards the chosen target white. This may result in hard clipping, which can lead to a loss of detail in the highlights. target white The upper bound that the curve converges to. This can be used to limit the maximum output luminance. toe start Defines the point where the linear portion of the curve ends and the toe begins. Keeping the value at 0% allows the smooth transition to start at the pivot. Higher values push the transition point down towards the chosen target black. This may result in hard clipping, which can lead to a loss of detail in the shadows. target black The lower bound that the curve converges to. This can be used to create a faded analog look, similar to the lift control in the look section or the global offset in color balance rgb. keep the pivot on the diagonal Automatically adjusts curve y gamma in an attempt to ensure the curve remains S-shaped, as long as the contrast setting is high enough. It works much like auto adjust hardness in filmic rgb. While the checkbox is ticked, curve y gamma cannot be adjusted manually, and is hidden. curve y gamma Shifts the representation of the pivot along the y-axis without changing its output luminance. This is an internal parameter of the algorithm and does not need to match your display\u0026rsquo;s gamma. Its purpose is mainly to enable you to keep the S-shape of the curve, thereby ensuring that the shoulder power and toe power controls remain effective. Manual adjustments are disabled while keep the pivot on the diagonal is enabled. 🔗look The \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo; controls define how the image is processed after the tone mapping operation. This means that they are display-referred operations, and can result in clipping, so use them carefully.\nslope Multiplies the output values by this factor. Black is not affected (since it has a value of 0). Values above 1 brighten the image and increase contrast, whereas those below 1 darken the image and reduce contrast. lift Shifts values up or down. Only blacks are fully affected, with the effect gradually reduced for brighter tones. Whites are not affected if slope is at its default value of 1. Negative values crush shadows, whereas positive values can produce a faded look. brightness Applies a power function (gamma adjustment) to the image. The black and white points are not affected. Values above 1 will raise the mid-tones, opening up shadows, whereas those below 1 will darken the mid-tones and compress shadows. saturation Controls color intensity by adjusting the image\u0026rsquo;s chroma. For a precise definition of chroma vs. saturation, please see darktable\u0026rsquo;s color dimensions. A value of zero makes the image monochrome. preserve hue The tone mapping curve, being a per-channel curve, introduces color shifts, with color tending towards the primary (red, green and blue) and secondary (yellow, cyan and magenta) colors in the highlights. At a value of 0%, these color shifts are retained. By raising this slider, the input hues (those before the tone curve) can be partially or fully restored. Note that the input hues themselves are affected by the \u0026ldquo;primaries manipulations\u0026rdquo; that are performed before tone mapping, and the final hues are affected by the \u0026ldquo;primaries manipulations\u0026rdquo; that are applied after tone mapping. For a detailed description of the order of the operations, see technical details below. 🔗the primaries tab The primaries tab controls are similar to, but more extensive than, those of the collapsible primaries section in the sigmoid module:\ndisable adjustments Turns off all manipulation of primaries. You are not advised to tick this checkbox for actual processing \u0026ndash; it is intended more as a learning tool for quick comparisons. For a starting point without adjustments that can be fine-tuned manually, use the unmodified configuration. reset primaries Clicking this button reveals a pop-up menu to apply one of the built-in sets of primaries, without altering any of the other settings. base primaries Defines which color space is used as the basis of the AgX processing space. The attenuation and rotation controls below are applied relative to this space. For especially problematic colors, you may find that wider spaces provide better control. 🔗before tone mapping The controls in this group affect the operations performed before the tone mapping curve is applied.\nred/green/blue attenuation Controls the amount of desaturation applied to the primary color. This adjusts the rate of the color\u0026rsquo;s shift towards white as its intensity increases. Lower values result in a slower shift and more pronounced hue changes, at the risk of artifacts. The saturation of all colors will be reduced, regardless of luminosity, but this can be reversed for shadows and mid-tones using the purity boost sliders in the after tone mapping section, the overall effect being a desaturation of highlights. red/green/blue rotation Rotates the hue angle of the primary color. This affects the direction of the hue shift for colors as their intensity changes. For example, rotating red can influence whether it bends towards yellow or magenta. 🔗after tone mapping The controls in this group affect the processing performed after tone mapping. Use them as artistic controls to help you achieve the desired final look.\nreverse all Ticking this checkbox will hide the other controls in the group, and adjust processing settings as if the master reversal sliders, discussed below, were set to 100%, the purity boost parameters to match the values of the corresponding attenuation sliders, and the reverse rotation parameters to mirror the values set with the rotation sliders. The values of the hidden sliders will be retained, but not used for processing. Unchecking the checkbox will make them visible, and their settings effective, again. The checkbox is intended to simplify the user interface (users may wish to create presets with the checkbox ticked), and for quick \u0026ldquo;what-if\u0026rdquo; checks. set from above Clicking the button will copy the values of the sliders from the before tone mapping section, and set the master controls to 100%, producing the same visual effect as ticking reverse all. However, this only provides a starting point \u0026ndash; the sliders will not be hidden, and may be adjusted to taste. master purity boost, master rotation reversal These are multipliers that affect the individual red/green/blue controls below, allowing you to globally increase or decrease their effect. red/green/blue purity boost Restores color purity after the tone curve is applied. Higher values make the image look more colorful and chroma-laden, but can introduce artifacts if pushed too far. When combined with attenuation (above), the net effect is a selective desaturation of highlights (since the purity boost does not fully recover purity in highlights, due to them being strongly desaturated by the tone mapping process). red/green/blue reverse rotation Reverses the initial primary rotation after the tone curve. This offers a final control over the rendered hues. This can be used to partly or fully reverse the hue shifts introduced by the corresponding rotation sliders, mostly in the shadows and mid-tones. Since the curve is applied per-channel, it is subject to the \u0026ldquo;Notorious 6\u0026rdquo; shifts, which mostly affect highlights. 🔗presets The module provides built-in presets, based on Blender, and on the smooth preset of the sigmoid module. When adjusting primaries starting from those presets, you will need to take the following into account:\nIn Blender, the rotation of primaries is not reversed, and purity is restored using values different from those used for attenuation. Therefore, the corresponding blender-like and scene-referred default presets of AgX come with master purity boost = 100%, master rotation reversal = 0%. This means that, although the per-channel rotation reversal sliders are set up for complete reversal, they have no effect. You can turn them on gradually by raising the master rotation reversal control, and, once that is no longer set to 0%, adjust the individual channel sliders according to taste. In the sigmoid module\u0026rsquo;s smooth preset, rotations are always completely reversed, but purity is not boosted at all by default. Therefore, the corresponding AgX presets, also called smooth, set master purity boost = 0%, master rotation reversal = 100%. The per-channel purity boost sliders are set to completely reverse the attenuation, but are effectively disabled by the master slider. The per-channel rotation reversal sliders mirror the settings of the reversal slider, and are fully enabled by the master control. You are, of course, free to create your own presets with your favorite combination of master and per-channel controls (for example, having the master reversal controls at 100% and the per-channel controls set to your preferred values).\n🔗selective tuning for mid-tones and highlights It is important to note that using the primaries controls, the properties of the S-curve (lower contrast in highlights), and per-channel application of the curve together make it possible to apply different adjustments to mid-tones and highlights, even though this may not be evident at the first glance.\nPer-channel S-curves have the property of desaturating highlights, independently of the attenuation control. This means you can reverse the attenuation (restore saturation) for mid-tones using purity boost, but not so for highlights.\nAnother property of per-channel S-curves is the skewing of bright colors mentioned above: the \u0026ldquo;Notorious 6\u0026rdquo;. AgX cleverly uses this effect to exaggerate hue shifts introduced using the rotation of primaries. For example, a red primary rotated a few degrees towards green (yellow) will turn ever so slightly yellow, and this can be reversed later using the red reverse rotation slider, if desired. However, for brighter tones, the \u0026ldquo;Notorious 6\u0026rdquo; shift will skew the slightly yellow-tinted red more towards yellow, allowing you to obtain orange sunsets instead of pink ones. The reverse rotation will not recover this additional skew fully. To control how much additional skew you want to allow, use the preserve hue slider in the look section.\n🔗recommended workflow The following workflow is recommended when using this module:\nSet overall exposure for the mid-tones using the exposure module. Alternatively, use contrast and toe / shoulder power to fill the output tonal range. Choose a preset as a starting point. If darktable is set to apply a scene-referred workflow by default (see preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults), the module will apply reasonable defaults automatically. In other cases (for example, when using the legacy display-referred workflow or if the workflow preference is set to \u0026ldquo;none\u0026rdquo;), manually select the preset blender-like|base or smooth|base for best results. The punchy presets are more contrasty and colorful. Use the auto tune levels picker to set the desired exposure range. Set the pivot on the subject using the picker next to pivot relative exposure (optional) \u0026ndash; this ensures that contrast is maximized around the selected area. Move the pivot target output slider to adjust the brightness of the pivot point (optional). Set the contrast. Adjust toe and shoulder power to set contrast in shadows and highlights, respectively (optional). Finally, if desired, you may add \u0026ldquo;drama\u0026rdquo; by adjusting the controls in the look section \u0026ndash; add brightness, set overall saturation, and adjust colors with preserve hue. Please also note the following:\nThe provided presets (with the exception of unmodified base primaries) provide carefully tuned primaries. When starting out, it is best to rely on those settings. Adjusting them, based on individual taste and/or special lighting conditions (e.g. LED lights, stage lighting) is part of a more advanced workflow. Unless high quality processing is enabled, the effect of adjusting the primaries cannot be judged properly, especially with highly saturated colors and narrow-spectrum light sources like LEDs. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that the AgX module is just another tone mapper. As flexible as it is, it is not intended to solve all image processing tasks related to color and contrast, many of which will be better resolved by using other modules. 🔗additional options The following additional options are \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; by default but can be toggled by manually editing your darktablerc file while darktable is closed.\n🔗\u0026ldquo;3 tab\u0026rdquo; mode For people with small screens, where vertical screen-space is at a premium, an optional \u0026ldquo;3 tab\u0026rdquo; mode is provided in order to reduce the need to scroll the module. This mode moves the plot of the curve and advanced curve parameters from the settings tab into a dedicated curve tab, and duplicates some other controls from the settings tab for convenience.\nYou can enable this mode by setting plugins/darkroom/agx/enable_curve_tab=TRUE in darktablerc. When set to FALSE, all curve controls appear on the settings tab as normal.\n🔗disabling curve warnings The warnings documented within the basic curve parameters section can be disabled by setting plugins/darkroom/agx/enable_curve_warnings=FALSE in darktablerc.\n🔗always expand the \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo; section By default, the look controls are placed inside a collapsible section. If you want to keep them visible at all times, you can set plugins/darkroom/agx/look_always_visible=TRUE in darktablerc.\n🔗technical details The following is a detailed description of the steps taken when processing with the AgX module. This section is provided as a reference for interested readers, but is not required to use the module.\nLinear, scene-referred data arrives in the pipe\u0026rsquo;s working space, defined in the input color profile module (e.g. Rec 2020) If needed, data is converted to the selected \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; space Colors that are out-of-gamut for the \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; space (RGB triplets that have any negative component in that space) are \u0026ldquo;slid\u0026rdquo; into gamut (in-gamut colors are not modified, though it is possible that a previously out-of-gamut color \u0026ldquo;lands on top of\u0026rdquo; an in-gamut color). The sigmoid module performs a similar operation, but the method is different. An input matrix is calculated and applied, based on the RGB attenuation and primaries rotation values. This desaturates the colors (mixing channels into each-other) and rotates the primaries. This is the same as with sigmoid. The HSV representation is calculated from the inset+rotated RGB. The hue (H) will be used later to restore the hue according to the look / preserve hue slider. For each component (RGB channel), the same processing steps are executed independently (but, since the desaturation (primaries attenuation) mixes channels into each-other, this means that with respect to the original color, the processing is not independent at all): Log encoding is applied: for input x, log2(x) is calculated (x would be the value of the red, green or blue channel) The log value is scaled and shifted according to the selected exposure parameters, so the selected black point becomes 0, the white point 1, and the value corresponding to mid-gray (18%) ends up on the x-axis of the curve in a ratio black relative exposure : white relative exposure (by default, 10 : 6.5, or at about 0.61) The curve is applied. This produces an output that is considered to be encoded according to the gamma. This can be considered as data ready to be displayed on a monitor using the specified gamma value (the gamma is only used for processing, and does not have to match the gamma of the display used for editing, or that of the output color space). The look is applied in pure display-referred mode, like legacy editing of gamma-encoded images, and similar to editing sRGB JPGs in traditional editors. Except for saturation, these are also per-channel operations: first the slope and the lift then the brightness finally the saturation For each channel, the gamma-encoded data is linearized by applying linear = gamma_encoded ^ gamma (so it is scene-referred 0..1, but the encoding is linear, like always in darktable\u0026rsquo;s pipeline; mid-gray is at 0.18) The HSV representation of the result is calculated. The resulting hue (from the H component) and the original hue are mixed together according to the preserve hue setting to produce the final hue. This does not guarantee complete preservation of color, as the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; hue was already recorded after the input matrix, and after this mix, the output matrix (see the next step) modifies colors again. The output matrix is applied to each channel, which: performs the rotation reversal (this is a difference with sigmoid: the latter always completely reverses the rotation, in AgX, reversal is up to the user) applies the purity boost (just like sigmoid) converts the result back into the pipe working space.

This feature allows you to merge the image with one or two copies of itself after applying the current base curve and boosting its exposure by a selected number of EV units. The resulting image is thus a combination of two or three different exposures of the original image. Use this feature to compress the dynamic range of extremely underexposed images or for true HDR input.

This slider is only visible if the exposure fusion feature is activated. exposure bias (fusion) Determines how the multiple exposures are computed. With a bias of 1 (the default), the image is fused with overexposed copies of itself. With a bias of -1, it is fused with underexposed copies. A bias of 0 attempts to preserve the overall lightness of the image by combining both over- and underexposed copies of the image.

The module will turn each luminous point from the scene into a blot shaped like the displayed blurring operator, with the size of the blot defined by the blur radius.\n🔗module controls 🔗general blur radius The spreading size of the blur. blur type Choose between the different blur variants (above). 🔗controls specific to lens blur diaphragm blades The number of blades that the diaphragm is composed of. Older lenses used typically 5 or 7 blades, newer lenses typically use 9 or 11 blades. In any case, real lenses have an odd number of blades and any number greater than 11 blades comes very close to producing a perfect disc. If you degenerate the diaphragm settings with the concavity to create a star or an asterisk, this control defines how many branches it has. concavity a concavity of 1 ensures the diaphragm is a regular convex polygon (triangle, pentagon, heptagon, etc.). a concavity greater than 1 but lower than number of blades - 1 turns the shape into a star. a concavity greater than number of blades - 1 but lower than number of blades turns the shape into an asterisk, when decreasing linearity below 1. a concavity greater than or equal to number of blades degenerates the shape into a \u0026ldquo;burst pattern\u0026rdquo;. linearity a linearity of 0 creates a disc, no matter the number of blades or the concavity. a linearity of 1 makes all the outer bounds of the shape straight. a linearity between 0 and 1 makes the outer bounds of the shape more or less curved. rotation Allows the shape to be rotated with respect to its center \u0026ndash; mostly useful with a small number of blades, when a particular orientation is needed. 🔗controls specific to motion blur direction The orientation of the motion\u0026rsquo;s path in angular degrees. 0° is horizontal motion. curvature The curvature of the motion. Zero produces a straight line, a negative value produces a concave curvature, a positive value produces a convex curvature. offset Shifts along the motion path following its curve. This is useful to select a portion of the curved path that is symmetrical, which produces a coma shape (example 1: direction = -45°, curvature = +2, offset = +0.5 ; example 2 : direction = -45°, curvature = +1, offset = +1). 🔗caveats This module is implemented using a \u0026ldquo;naive\u0026rdquo; convolution, which is a slow algorithm. Faster approaches are available (using FFT) but not yet implemented. The GPU implementation, through OpenCL, should hide this issue somewhat. In any case, the runtime of the module will increase with the square of the blur radius.\nThe blurring process does not take scene depth and depth-of-field into account, but blurs the whole image as a flat object. It is therefore not suitable for creating fake depth-of-field. Using darktable\u0026rsquo;s general masking will only partially work to isolate the foreground of an image, since it will still be blurred into the background.\n🔗tips and tricks All images are usually (even a tiny bit) noisy. If you blur only a part of the image, the blurred region will look suspiciously clean compared to the rest of the image. It is therefore a good idea to add a bit of noise on top of the blurred part to blend it with the rest, using either the grain or the censorize modules.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/blurs/","tags":null,"title":"blurs"},{"categories":null,"content":"Degrade parts of the image in an aesthetically pleasing way, in order to anonymize people/objects or hide body parts.\nCensorize works in linear RGB color space to apply a physically-accurate gaussian blur and gaussian luminance noise.\nAside from anonymization, this module can also be used for a wide range of creative purposes, for example:\nCombine a simple blur with a multiply blend mode to create a realistic bloom (Orton effect).

For scene-referred workflow, you should consider using the improved color balance rgb module instead.\n🔗overview The color balance module allows you to shift colors selectively by luminance range (shadows, mid-tones, and highlights). It can do this using two different methods:\nlift, gamma, gain The classic method, which allows a more separated control of shadows versus highlights. slope, offset, power The new standard defined by the American Society of Cinematographers Color Decision List (ASC CDL) and more suited to scene-referred editing. The master settings affect the whole image. They are not available in lift, gamma, gain (sRGB) mode. The slider ranges are limited to usual values ([50%; 150%] for saturation, [-50%; 50%] for contrast), but higher and lower values can be defined via keyboard input after right-clicking on the corresponding slider.\nFor better efficiency, in slope, offset, power mode it is recommended that you set the slope first, then the offset, and finally the power, in that order. The name of the mode can be use as a mnemonic to remember the order.\nThe shadows parameter has a far heavier effect in slope, offset, power mode than in lift, gamma, gain mode. When switching from the former to the latter, you should adapt the saturation in shadows, dividing by around 10.\nNote: Although this module acts on RGB colors its location in the pixelpipe puts it into the Lab color space. Accordingly the module converts from Lab to RGB, performs its color adjustments, and then converts back to Lab.\n🔗presets Several presets are provided in this module to help you to better understand how it can best be used. The \u0026ldquo;teal/orange color-grading\u0026rdquo; preset is a very popular look in cinema and is a good showcase model. It is meant to be used with two instances combined with masks. The first instance will exclude skin tones and will shift neutral colors toward teal blue. The second will partially revert the first one and add more vibrance to skin tones only. Together they will create separation between subject and background. The masking and blending parameters will need to be tweaked to suit every image.\nOther presets provide Kodak film emulations. In this way you can recreate any film look you like using color balance.\n🔗module controls mode lift, gamma, gain (sRGB) is the legacy mode from darktable 2.4 and earlier. In this mode, the color transformations are applied in sRGB color space encoded with the sRGB gamma (average gamma of 2.2). lift, gamma, gain (ProPhoto RGB) is the same as the previous mode but works in ProPhoto RGB space, encoded linearly. In this mode, the RGB parameters are corrected in XYZ luminance (Y channel) internally so they affect only the color, and only the “factors” adjust the luminance.\nslope, offset, power (ProPhoto RGB) applies the ASC CDL in ProPhoto RGB space, encoded linearly. As with the previous mode, the RGB parameters are corrected in XYZ luminance internally. In this mode, the slope parameter acts as an exposure compensation, the offset acts as a black level correction, and the power acts as a gamma correction. All parameters will have some impact on the whole luminance range but the slope will mostly affect the highlights, the offset will mostly affect the shadows, and the power will mostly affect the mid-tones.\ncolor control sliders This combobox selection affects the user interface used for the shadows, mid-tones and highlights controls. RGBL controls allow direct access to the RGB parameters that will be sent to the algorithm and internally adjusted in XYZ luminance, depending on the mode used. They are the only ones stored in darktable\u0026rsquo;s development history.\nHSL controls are more intuitive, but are only an interface: the hues and saturations are computed dynamically from and to the RGB parameters and never stored. During the HSL to RGB conversion, the HSL lightness is always assumed to be 50%, so the RGB parameters are always balanced to avoid lightness changes. However, during the RGB to HSL conversion, the HSL lightness is not corrected.\nAs a consequence, editing in RGB, then in HSL, then again in RGB will not retain the original RGB parameters, but will normalize them so their HSL lightness is 50%. The difference is barely noticeable in most cases, especially using the modes that already correct the RGB parameters internally in XYZ luminance.\nIn both modes, additional “factor” sliders act on all RGB channels at once. Their effect is similar to the controls of the levels module and affect only the luminance.\ninput saturation A saturation correction applied before the color balance. This can be used to dampen colors before adjusting the balance, to make difficult images easier to process. When you entirely desaturate the image, this creates a luminance-based monochrome image that can be used as a luminance mask, to create color filters with the color balance settings, like a split-toning or sepia effect (when used with blending modes). output saturation A saturation correction applied after the color balance. This is useful once you have found a proper hue balance but find the effect too heavy, so you can adjust the global saturation at once instead of editing each channel saturation separately at the expense of possibly messing up the colors. contrast / contrast fulcrum The contrast slider allows the luminance separation to be increased. The fulcrum value defines the luminance value that will not be affected by the contrast correction, so the contrast will roll over the fulcrum. Luminance values above the fulcrum will be amplified almost linearly. Luminance values below the fulcrum value will be compressed with a power function (creating a toe). This correction comes after the output saturation and is applied on all RGB channels separately, so hues and saturations might not be preserved in case of dramatic settings (shadows might be resaturated, highlights might be desaturated, and some color shift is to be expected). shadows, mid-tones, highlights Depending on the mode used, the shadows settings will control either the lift or the offset, the mid-tones settings will control either the gamma or the power, and the highlights settings will control either the gain or the slope. Parameters are transferred unaltered when you change the mode. In RGBL mode, the RGB sliders\u0026rsquo; range is limited to [-0.5; 0.5]. In HSL mode, the saturation sliders range is limited to [0%; 25%]. Values outside of these bounds can be defined with keyboard input by right-clicking on the slider.\nNote: The shadows, mid-tones and highlights sliders can take up a great deal of space in the color balance module. The overall layout of these sliders can therefore be cycled through three different layouts by clicking on the shadows, mid-tones, highlights heading.\noptimize luma The picker beside the optimize luma label will select the whole image and optimize the factors for shadows, mid-tones and highlights so that the average luminance of the image is 50% Lab, the maximum is 100% and the minimum is 0%, at the output of this module. This is essentially histogram normalization, similar to that performed by the levels module. The optimizer is only really accurate when used in slope, offset, power mode. If you want more control, you can define three control patches by using the pickers beside each factor slider to sample luminance in selected areas. The shadows picker samples the minimum luminance, the mid-tones picker samples the average luminance, and the highlights picker samples the maximum luminance. The most sensitive parameter is the mid-tones factor, since selecting a slightly different area can lead to dramatic parameter changes. Using the factors pickers alone, without triggering the luma optimization, will allow you to perform adjustments without general optimization, but each parameter is always computed taking the other two into account. Once patches are selected, the label changes to read “optimize luma from patches”. To reset one patch, you can just redo the selection. Patches are not saved in the parameters and are retained only during the current session.\nIt is important to note that the luminance adjustment targets only the output of the color balance module and does not account for adjustments performed in other modules later in the pixelpipe (e.g. filmic rgb, tone curve, color zones, levels). Using the color balance module to remap the luminance globally on the image is not recommended because it does not preserve the original colors \u0026ndash; modules such as tone curve or filmic rgb are better suited for this purpose. Luminance adjustments in color balance are better performed, in combination with color adjustments, using masks.\nneutralize colors In an image where some areas are exposed to direct sunlight and some areas are exposed to reflected light (shadows), or where several artificial light sources are present simultaneously, shadows and highlights often have different color temperatures. These images are particularly difficult to correct since no general white balance will match all the colors at once. The color neutralization optimizer aims at helping you find the complementary color for shadows, mid-tones, and highlights so that all the color casts are reverted, and the average color of the image is a neutral gray. As with the luma optimization, the picker beside the neutralize colors label will trigger a general optimization over the whole image. This works fairly well in landscape photography, or for any photograph with a full spectrum of colors and luminances.\nFor night and events photography, this will most likely fail and you will need to manually input the sampling areas with the picker beside each hue slider. For the highlights sample, use a color exposed to spotlights that should be neutral white or light gray. For the shadows sample, use a color exposed to ambient light that should be neutral black or dark gray. For the mid-tones sample, use a color exposed by both ambient and spotlights.\nThe success of the optimization depends on the quality of the samples. Not every set of samples will converge to a good solution and you need to ensure that the color patches you choose are really a neutral color in real life. In many cases the optimizer will output the correct hue but an excessive saturation that will need some extra tweaking. In some cases, no valid optimization will be delivered and you will need to reset the saturation parameters and start over, or simply stop after the patches selection. Note that in the auto-optimization, the maximum saturation is 25%, which might not be enough in very few cases but will avoid inconsistent results in most.\nIf you select color patches from the hue pickers without triggering the optimization, the software will only perform one round of optimization and then stop. This allows you to control each luminance range separately and avoid divergence of the solution in corner cases. The hue and saturation corrections are computed taking into account the two other luminance ranges and three factors, and will always output the complementary color of the selected area. If you want to reinforce the color of the area instead, you can then add 180° to the computed hue. Once patches are selected, the label changes to read “neutralize colors from patches”. To reset one patch you can just redo the selection. Patches are not saved in the parameters and are retained only during the current session. The parameters found by the automatic neutralization are accurate only in slope, offset, power mode, but can work to some extent in lift, gamma, gain mode too.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/color-balance/","tags":null,"title":"color balance"},{"categories":null,"content":"An advanced module which brings color-grading tools from cinematography into the photographic scene-referred pipeline.\nThis module is not suitable for beginners with no prior knowledge of color theory, who might want to stick to the global chroma and global vibrance settings until they have a good understanding of the dimensions of color.\n🔗introduction Color-grading is an important part of image editing. It can help to remove unwanted color casts and can also deliver a creative color twist that will add atmosphere to your images. In the days of film photography, most of the color ambiance was obtained with the film emulsion and the developing chemicals, with some color timing being performed under the enlarger with color heads. This consumed expensive resources and was mostly reserved for the cinema industry, where the job was performed by a colorist.\nIn the digital age, where raw images look flat and even, color-grading assumes the same role that film emulsions did, by re-introducing color shifts for aesthetic purposes. It can also serve to harmonize the color palette of a series of images (which may have been shot under different conditions) to achieve a consistent global look. For this task, the vectorscope is also extremely useful.\nColorists usually split color-grading into two distinct steps:\nPrimary color-grading aims to fix unwanted color casts and create a neutral starting point, Secondary color-grading gives the image its final look and atmosphere. Primary color-grading is best left to the color calibration module, which operates in a physical framework better suited to illuminant correction. Color balance RGB, on the other hand, is mostly concerned with secondary color-grading. Performing a truly neutral primary color-grading should make the secondary color-grading easy to transfer between images (via styles, presets or copy \u0026amp; paste) with a similar effect.\n🔗general principles The color balance RGB module is an improvement over the American Society of Cinematographers Color Decision List (ASC CDL), and uses alpha masks to allow the effect to be properly split between shadows and highlights. The classic CDL acts on the entire luminance range, and each of its parameters is given more weight on some parts of the image only as a side-effect of the mathematics.\nThis module works, for the most part (4 ways, chroma, vibrance, contrast), in a linear RGB color space designed specifically for color-grading. This color space exhibits a uniform spacing of perceptual hues while retaining a physically-scaled luminance1. The perceptual part of the module (saturation and brilliance) works in the JzAzBz2 color space, which provides a perceptual scaling of both lightness and chromaticity suitable for HDR images. Both color spaces ensure that saturation and chroma changes take place at constant hue, which is not the case for most other saturation operators in darktable (notably in the older color balance module).\nThe color balance RGB module expects a scene-referred linear input and produces a scene-referred RGB output, which may or may not be linear, depending on the module settings (contrast and power will delinearize the output).\nAt its output, color balance RGB checks that the graded colors fit inside the pipeline RGB color space (Rec. 2020 by default) and applies a soft saturation clipping at constant hue, aiming to retarget out-of-gamut color to the nearest in-gamut color by scaling both chroma and lightness. This prevents the chroma and saturation settings from pushing colors outside of the valid range and allows more drastic adjustments to be safely used.\nNote that this module abides by the CIE definitions of chroma and saturation, as explained in the dimensions of color section.\n🔗module controls 🔗master tab hue shift Rotate all colors in the image by an angle over the chromaticity plane, at constant luminance and chroma. You can use this control to remove spilled colored light on a subject or to quickly change the color of some object. This setting is usually best applied locally, using masks. global vibrance This affects the chroma dimension of color over the entire image, prioritizing those colors with low chroma. This allows the chroma of neutral colors to be increased without exaggerating already-colorful pixels. contrast This setting is applied on the luminance channel at constant hue and chroma. The fulcrum setting (in the masks tab, under contrast gray fulcrum) allows you to set the neutral point of the contrast curve: at the fulcrum, the contrast curve leaves the luminance unchanged, below the fulcrum, the contrast curve decreases the luminance for positive contrast values, or increases it for negative values, above the fulcrum, the contrast curve increases the luminance for positive contrast values, or decreases it for negative values. The fulcrum has a value of 18.45% by default, which is consistent with the current scene-referred workflow and should fit most use cases (assuming that global brightness has been fixed as recommended using the exposure module).\nThe contrast algorithm gives natural results that mimic the central part of the contrast curve of analog film. However, it will also increase the image\u0026rsquo;s dynamic range, which may void filmic settings in the pipe. For global contrast adjustments, you should normally use the tone equalizer module \u0026ndash; the color balance RGB contrast slider is best used with masks, e.g. for selective corrections over the foreground or background.\n🔗linear chroma grading Linear chroma grading affects the chroma dimension proportionally to its input value, at constant hue and luminance. It does this globally, with a flat coefficient (using the global chroma), as well as on each of the shadows, mid-tones and highlights masks (defined in the masks tab under luminance ranges).\n🔗perceptual saturation grading Perceptual saturation grading affects both the luminance and the chroma dimensions, in a perceptual space, proportionally to its input value, at constant hue. It does this globally, with a flat coefficient (using the global saturation), as well as on each of the shadows, mid-tones and highlights masks (defined in the masks tab under luminance ranges).\n🔗perceptual brilliance grading Perceptual brilliance grading affects both the luminance and the chroma dimensions, in a perceptual space, proportionally to its input value, at constant hue, and in a direction orthogonal to the saturation. Its effect is close to that of changing exposure, but scaled perceptually. It does this globally, with a flat coefficient (using the global saturation), as well as on each of the shadows, mid-tones and highlights masks (defined in the masks tab under luminance ranges). Brilliance Values outside the range -20% - 20% are likely to create artifacts, and are best avoided.\n🔗4 ways tab Each of the settings in the 4 ways tab is composed of the same three components, which define a color using independent coordinates:\nluminance, hue, chroma. Color input like this defines a color shift applied to the image globally or over the specified luminance range.\nEach hue slider has a picker, which may be used to compute the opponent color of the selected region. This is useful to revert unwanted color casts (e.g. skin redness), since shifting the color to its opponent cast neutralizes it. You can also select the current color by Ctrl+clicking on the picker.\n🔗global offset This is equivalent to the ASC CDL offset and falls back to adding a constant RGB value to all pixels, quite like the black offset in the exposure module. This control does not use masking.\n🔗shadows lift This is conceptually equivalent to the lift from lift/gamma/gain, although implemented differently, and falls back to multiplying the masked pixels by a constant RGB value. It is applied using the shadows mask.\n🔗highlights gain This is equivalent to the ASC CDL slope, and falls back to multiplying a the masked pixels by a constant RGB value. It is applied using the highlights mask.\n🔗global power This is equivalent to the ASC CDL power, and falls back to applying a constant RGB exponent. It is not masked and needs to be normalized, since the power function has a different behaviour above and below 1, and we are in an unbounded pipeline where white is typically greater than 1. The normalization parameter is available in the masks tab under white fulcrum.\n🔗masks tab This tab defines auxiliary controls for the previous tabs. You should at least set the white fulcrum threshold, as that value is used to normalize brightness levels; leaving it at the default may introduce artifacts in other modules later in the pipeline (filmic rgb highlight recovery being the prominent example).\n🔗luminance ranges The graphs show the opacity (on the y axis) of the 3 luminance masks relative to the pixel luminance (on the x axis). The darkest curve represents the shadows mask, the brightest represents the highlights mask, and the third curve represents the mid-tones mask.\nOnly the shadows and highlights masks can be controlled directly \u0026ndash; the mid-tones mask is computed indirectly from the others and acts as an adjustment variable.\nshadows fall-off Control the softness or hardness of the transition from fully opaque (100%) to fully transparent (0%) for the shadows mask. mask middle-gray fulcrum Set the luminance value where all three masks have 50% opacity. In practice, this is used to define how the image is separated into shadows and highlights. highlights fall-off Control the softness or hardness of the transition from fully opaque (100%) to fully transparent (0%) for the highlights mask. For each of these settings, a mask button, provided to the right of the slider, displays the appropriate mask (shadows, mid-tones, highlights), overlaid as a checker board. The still-visible area of the image (not hidden by the mask) is the area that will be affected by the shadows, mid-tones and highlights sliders in the other tabs.\nAll mask previews display the output of the module, including any color changes made, so you can also activate them while editing, to see only the affected part of the image.\nLuminance masks are computed at the input of the module, which means that they are insensitive to any luminance changes made inside the module.\n🔗thresholds white fulcrum Set the white point luminance in EV. This is used to normalize the power setting in the 4 ways tab, and also to normalize brightness levels. Display-referred implementations of power functions assume that white is at 100%, which removes the need for normalization. For scene-referred purposes this needs to be taken into account. The picker to the right of the slider automatically sets the white fulcrum to the maximum luminance from the selected region, which should be sufficient in most cases.\ncontrast gray fulcrum Set the fulcrum for the contrast setting in the master tab. This corresponds to the luminance value that will be left unchanged by the contrast adjustment. This setting usually matches the middle-gray linear value. If you followed the scene-referred workflow recommendations and set the global brightness early in the pipeline, using the exposure module, the correct value should usually be around 18-20%. The picker to the right of the slider automatically sets the contrast gray fulcrum to the average luminance from the selected region. This relies on the assumption that the average luminance is usually close to middle-gray, which is not true if you have specular highlights or primary light sources in the frame, or for low/high-key images.\n🔗saturation formula Note that this setting is not really appropriate for the masks tab (since it is not technically related to the masks) but is placed here because it is not meant to be used regularly and in the spirit of saving some display real-estate. Two options are provided:\nJzAzBz (2021) This mode is the original saturation algorithm. It uses the JzAzBz uniform color space (UCS) to compute the saturation. This color space is not meant for color changes and its lightness does not account for the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect, which states that colorful colors will look brighter than neutral or near-neutral colors (greys and pastels) having the same luminance. It also suffers from non-smooth behaviour near black, with colors being darkened too much. darktable UCS (2022) The darktable Uniform Color Space has been designed from the ground up, using psychoperceptual measurement datasets, for the sole purpose of the color manipulation (saturation) performed by this module. This color space does account for the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect and has a built-in gamut mapping formula that is more accurate and efficient than can be achieved in JzAzBz. It displays a smoother behaviour which makes saturation changes more even across the lightness range. 🔗mask preview settings These settings apply to the mask previews, displayed by clicking the mask buttons in the luminance ranges section. These settings are saved globally, so will be applied to all subsequent images unless changed.\nchecker board color 1 and 2 Set the two colors for the background checker board mask underlay. You can set them to opponent colors of the current image to aid legibility. checker board size Set the width of the checker board cells in pixels (adjusted according to the display\u0026rsquo;s DPI setting). 🔗FAQ 🔗saturation or chroma? As described in the dimensions of color section, saturation and chroma roam the (lightness, chroma) plane in different directions. In addition, the chroma of color balance RGB uses a scene-referred linear space, while the saturation uses a perceptual space, which rescales color for even spacing.\nIn practice, you should use the chroma setting if you want to preserve the scene-linearity of the light emission and/or keep the luminance unchanged. However, these changes might affect some hues more heavily than others, due to the fact that the color space is not fully perceptually-scaled.\nSaturation is closer to the effect of mixing white paint with some base color. Reducing the saturation of red will degrade it to pink, while reducing its chroma will degrade to a gray shade at the same luminance. Saturation is perhaps a more intuitive way to interact with color, due to its connection with painting.\nChoosing one or the other is mostly a matter of deciding where on the (lightness, chroma) graph you want to push your colors, and where they are to begin with. To reach pastel colors, saturation is the way to go. To reach laser-like colors (almost monochromatic), at the risk of looking synthetic, chroma is the way to go.\n🔗what is the connection with lift/gamma/gain? The lift/gamma/gain algorithm relies on a display-referred color space, since it assumes a bounded and symmetric dynamic range, with white point at 100% and gray at 50%. As such, it is simply unusable in a scene-referred space. However, the only incompatible part is the lift. The gamma is exactly the ASC CDL power, and the gain is exactly the ASC CDL slope.\nThe color balance RGB module simply has two slopes instead of one: the gain, applied on the highlights extracted from the whole image by a mask, and the lift, applied similarly but on the shadows.\n🔗changing contrast While color balance RGB is mostly about color (other modules handle the global contrast in chromaticity-preserving ways) luminance is as much a part of color as hue or chroma, and it needs to be dealt with here too, because the perception of saturation relies on it. If you wish to turn red into pink, for example, reducing its chroma will turn it gray, so you need to increase its luminance as well.\nThere are several ways to change the contrast in color balance RGB, either locally (with masks) or globally (without):\nin the master tab, use the contrast setting (possibly alongside the contrast gray fulcrum in the masks tab). Be aware that this will raise the white point and therefore increase the dynamic range of the image, which may void filmic settings later in the pipeline. in perceptual saturation grading, desaturate highlights and resaturate shadows to produce a luminance contrast boost, in perceptual brilliance grading, add brilliance in the highlights and remove brilliance in the shadows to produce to a luminance contrast boost, in the 4 ways tab, set the shadows lift luminance to negative values and the highlights gain luminance to positive values, which also produces a luminance contrast boost. The difference between these methods is how the effect will be weighted relative to the input of the module. You are advised to do the majority of luminance contrast adjustments in the filmic and tone equalizer modules, and then undertake final changes in color balance RGB while examining the colors.\n🔗internal processing The following is the internal order of operations within the module:\nTransform from pipeline RGB to Kirk/Filmlight Ych space, Apply hue shift at constant chroma and constant luminance, Compute luminance masks with Y, Apply the linear chroma and vibrance settings at constant hue and luminance, Transform to Kirk/Filmlight RGB space, Apply the 4 ways settings (except luminance power), Transform to Kirk/Filmlight Yrg space, Apply luminance power and contrast on Y, Transform to JzAzBz space, Apply the perceptual saturation and perceptual brilliance settings, Soft-clip the chroma using pipeline RGB gamut at constant hue and lightness, Transform back to pipeline RGB. 🔗caveats Setting the global chroma to -100% will not produce a real monochrome image, as is customary with other algorithms. The reason for this is that the RGB space used has a D65 white point defined in CIE LMS 2006 space, while darktable uses a white point defined in CIE XYZ 1931 space, and there is no exact conversion between these spaces. The result will therefore be a slightly tinted black \u0026amp; white image. If your intent is to get a real black \u0026amp; white image using the luminance channel, the color calibration module offers a B\u0026amp;W : luminance-based preset that does exactly the same thing but without the white-point discrepancy.\nThis module has its gamut-mapping (against pipeline RGB) permanently enabled. This means that if your original image contains some largely out-of-gamut colors to start with, simply enabling color balance RGB with no particular setting will slightly alter its colors. This is probably for the best.\nThe maximum saturation allowed in the pipeline working RGB space is recorded for each hue when initializing the module, and is later cached in a LUT (look-up table) to save performance. If the working profile is later changed, color balance RGB is not notified, meaning that it will not update its cached hue/saturation LUT. To force a LUT update, you can simply change any setting in the color balance RGB module, then change it back again. It is not recommended that you change the working RGB space half-way through an editing session, as this could result in unexpected chroma and hue changes.\nFor performance reasons, the non-linear conversions from and to the working RGB space are bypassed, meaning that the internal colorimetry will be wrong when using non-linear color spaces. Note that there is no reason to use non-linear spaces as working RGB since they make alpha blending more challenging for no benefit.\nRichard A.

Here, the white balance module makes some initial adjustments (required for the demosaic module to work effectively), and the color calibration module then calculates a more perceptually-accurate white balance after the input color profile has been applied.\nAs a simple RGB channel mixer, adjusting the R, G and B output channels based on the R, G and B input channels, to perform cross-talk color-grading.\nTo adjust the color saturation and brightness of the image, based on the relative strength of the R, G and B channels of each pixel.\nTo produce a grayscale output based on the relative strengths of the R, G and B channels, in a way similar to the response of black and white film to a light spectrum.\nTo improve the color accuracy of the input color profile using a color checker chart.\n🔗White Balance in the Chromatic Adaptation Transformation (CAT) tab Chromatic adaptation aims to predict how all surfaces in the scene would look if they had been lit by another illuminant. What we actually want to predict, though, is how those surfaces would have looked if they had been lit by the same illuminant as your monitor, in order to make all colors in the scene match the change of illuminant. White balance, on the other hand, aims only at ensuring that whites and grays are really neutral (R = G = B) and doesn’t really care about the rest of the color range. White balance is therefore only a partial chromatic adaptation.\nChromatic adaptation is controlled within the Chromatic Adaptation Transformation (CAT) tab of the color calibration module. When used in this way the white balance module is still required as it needs to perform a basic white balance operation (connected to the input color profile values). This technical white balancing (\u0026ldquo;camera reference\u0026rdquo; mode) is a flat setting that makes grays lit by a standard D65 illuminant look achromatic, and makes the demosaicing process more accurate, but does not perform any perceptual adaptation according to the scene. The actual chromatic adaptation is then performed by the color calibration module, on top of those corrections performed by the white balance and input color profile modules. The use of custom matrices in the input color profile module is therefore discouraged. Additionally, the RGB coefficients in the white balance module need to be accurate in order for this module to work in a predictable way.\nThe color calibration and white balance modules can be automatically applied to perform chromatic adaptation for new edits by setting the chromatic adaptation workflow option (preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; auto-apply chromatic adaptation defaults) to \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo;. If you prefer to perform all white balancing within the white balance module, a \u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo; option is also provided. Neither option precludes the use of other modules (such as color balance RGB) for creative color grading further along the pixel pipeline.\nBy default, color calibration performs chromatic adaptation by:\nreading the RAW file\u0026rsquo;s Exif data to fetch the scene white balance set by the camera, adjusting this setting using the camera reference white balance from the white balance module, further adjusting this setting with the input color profile in use (standard matrix only). For consistency, the color calibration module\u0026rsquo;s default settings always assume that the standard matrix is used in the input color profile module \u0026ndash; any non-standard settings in this module are ignored. However, color calibration\u0026rsquo;s defaults can read any auto-applied preset in the white balance module.\nIt is also worth noting that, unlike the white balance module, color calibration can be used with masks. This means that you can selectively correct different parts of the image to account for differing light sources.\nTo achieve this, create an instance of the color calibration module to perform global adjustments using a mask to exclude those parts of the image that you wish to handle differently. Then create a second instance of the module reusing the mask from the first instance (inverted) using a raster mask.\n🔗CAT tab workflow The default illuminant and color space used by the chromatic adaptation are initialised from the Exif metadata of the RAW file \u0026ldquo;as set in camera\u0026rdquo;.\nAlternatively you can use the picker (to the right of the color patch) to select a neutral color from the image or, if one is unavailable, select the entire image. In this case, the algorithm finds the average color within the chosen area and sets that color as the illuminant. This method relies on the \u0026ldquo;gray-world\u0026rdquo; assumption, which predicts that the average color of a natural scene will be neutral. This method will not work for artificial scenes, for example those with painted surfaces.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;as shot in camera\u0026rdquo; to restore the camera defaults and re-read the RAW Exif. The color patch shows the color of the currently calculated illuminant projected into sRGB space. The aim of the chromatic adaptation algorithm is to turn this color into pure white, which does not necessarily means shifting the image toward its perceptual opponent color. If the illuminant is properly set, the image will be given the same tint as shown in the color patch when the module is disabled.\nTo the left of the color patch is the CCT (correlated color temperature) approximation. This is the closest temperature, in kelvin, to the illuminant currently in use. In most image processing software it is customary to set the white balance using a combination of temperature and tint. However, when the illuminant is far from daylight, the CCT becomes inaccurate and irrelevant, and the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) discourages its use in such conditions. The CCT reading informs you of the closest CCT match found:\nWhen the CCT is followed by \u0026ldquo;(daylight)\u0026rdquo;, this means that the current illuminant is close to an ideal daylight spectrum ± 0.5 %, and the CCT figure is therefore meaningful. In this case, you are advised to use the \u0026ldquo;D (daylight)\u0026rdquo; illuminant. When the CCT is followed by \u0026ldquo;(black body)\u0026rdquo;, this means that the current illuminant is close to an ideal black body (Planckian) spectrum ± 0.5 %, and the CCT figure is therefore meaningful. In this case, you are advised to use the \u0026ldquo;Planckian (black body)\u0026rdquo; illuminant. When the CCT is followed by \u0026ldquo;(invalid)\u0026rdquo;, this means that the CCT figure is meaningless and wrong, because we are too far from either a daylight or a black body light spectrum. In this case, you are advised to use the custom illuminant. The chromatic adaptation will still perform as expected (see the note below), so the \u0026ldquo;(invalid)\u0026rdquo; tag only means that the current illuminant color is not accurately tied to the displayed CCT. This tag is nothing to be concerned about \u0026ndash; it is merely there to tell you to stay away from the daylight and planckian illuminants because they will not behave as you might expect. When one of the above illuminant detection methods is used, the module checks where the calculated illuminant sits using the two idealized spectra (daylight and black body) and chooses the most accurate spectrum model to use in its illuminant parameter. The user-interface will change accordingly:\nA temperature slider will be provided if the detected illuminant is close to a D (daylight) or Planckian (black body) spectrum, for which the CCT is meaningful. Hue and chroma sliders in CIE 1976 Luv space are offered for the custom illuminant, which allows direct selection of the illuminant color in a perceptual framework without any intermediate assumption. Note: Internally, the illuminant is represented by its absolute chromaticity coordinates in CIE xyY color space. The illuminant selection options in the module are merely interfaces to set up this chromaticity from real-world relationships and are intended to make this process faster. It does not matter to the algorithm if the CCT is tagged \u0026ldquo;invalid\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; this just means that the relationship between the CCT and the corresponding xyY coordinates is not physically accurate. Regardless, the color set for the illuminant, as displayed in the patch, will always be honored by the algorithm.\nWhen switching from one illuminant to another, the module attempts to translate the previous settings to the new illuminant as accurately as possible. Switching from any illuminant to custom preserves your settings entirely, since the custom illuminant is a general case. Switching between other modes, or from custom to any other mode, will not precisely preserve your settings from the previous mode due to rounding errors.\nOther hard-coded illuminants are available (see below). Their values come from standard CIE illuminants and are absolute. You can use them directly if you know exactly what kind of light bulb was used to illuminate the scene and if you trust your camera\u0026rsquo;s input profile and reference (D65) coefficients to be accurate. Otherwise, see caveats below.\n🔗CAT tab controls adaptation The working color space in which the module will perform its chromatic adaptation transform and channel mixing. The following options are provided: Linear Bradford (1985): This is accurate for illuminants close to daylight and is compatible with the ICC v4 standard, but produces out-of-gamut colors for more difficult illuminants. CAT16 (2016): This is the default option and is more robust in avoiding imaginary colors while working with large gamut or saturated cyan and purple. It is more accurate than the Bradford CAT in most cases. Non-linear Bradford (1985): This can sometimes produce better results than the linear version but is unreliable. XYZ: This is the least accurate method and is generally not recommended except for testing and debugging purposes. none (disable): Disable any adaptation and use the pipeline working RGB space. illuminant The type of illuminant assumed to have lit the scene. Choose from the following: same as pipeline (D50): Do not perform chromatic adaptation in this module instance but just perform channel mixing, using the selected adaptation color space. CIE standard illuminant: Choose from one of the CIE standard illuminants (daylight, incandescent, fluorescent, equi-energy, or black body), or a non-standard \u0026ldquo;LED light\u0026rdquo; illuminant. These values are all pre-computed \u0026ndash; as long as your camera sensor is properly profiled, you can just use them as-is. For illuminants that lie near the Planckian locus, an additional \u0026ldquo;temperature\u0026rdquo; control is also provided (see below). custom: If a neutral gray patch is available in the image, the color of the illuminant can be selected using the picker, or can be manually specified using hue and saturation sliders (in LCh perceptual color space). The color swatch next to the picker shows the color of the calculated illuminant used in the CAT compensation. as shot in camera: Calculate the illuminant based on the white balance settings provided by the camera. temperature Adjust the color temperature of the illuminant. Move the slider to the right to assume a more blue illuminant, which will make the white-balanced image appear warmer/more red. Move the slider to the left to assume a more red illuminant, which makes the image appear cooler/more blue after compensation. This control is only provided for illuminants that lie near the Planckian locus and provides fine-adjustment along that locus. For other illuminants the concept of \u0026ldquo;color temperature\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, so no temperature slider is provided.\nhue For custom white balance, set the hue of the illuminant color in LCh color space (derived from CIE Luv space). chroma For custom white balance, set the chroma (or saturation) of the illuminant color in LCh color space (derived from CIE Luv space). gamut compression Most camera sensors are slightly sensitive to invisible UV wavelengths, which are recorded on the blue channel and produce \u0026ldquo;imaginary\u0026rdquo; colors. Once corrected by the input color profile, these colors will end up out of gamut (that is, it may no longer be possible to represent certain colors as a valid [R,G,B] triplet with positive values in the working color space) and produce visual artifacts in gradients. The chromatic adaptation may also push other valid colors out of gamut, at the same time pushing any already out-of-gamut colors even further out of gamut. Gamut compression uses a perceptual, non-destructive, method to attempt to compress the chroma while preserving the luminance as-is and the hue as close as possible, in order to fit the whole image into the gamut of the pipeline working color space. One example where this feature is very useful is for scenes containing blue LED lights, which are often quite problematic and can result in ugly gamut clipping in the final image. clip negative RGB from gamut Remove any negative RGB values (set them to zero). This helps to deal with bad black level as well as the blue channel clipping issues that may occur with blue LED lights. This option is destructive for color (it may change the hue) but ensures a valid RGB output no matter what. It should never be disabled unless you want to take care of the gamut mapping manually and understand what you are doing. In that case, use the black level correction in the exposure module to get rid of any negative RGB (RGB means light, which is energy, and which should always be a positive quantity), then increase the gamut compression until no solid black patches remain in the image. Proper denoising may help getting rid of odd RGB values too. Note that this approach may still be insufficient to recover some deep and luminous shades of blue. Note 1: It has been reported that some OpenCL drivers don\u0026rsquo;t play well when negative RGB values are present in the pixel pipeline, because many pixel operators use logarithms and power functions (filmic, color balance, all the CIE Lab \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; CIE XYZ color space conversions), which are not defined for negative numbers. Although the inputs are sanitized before sensitive operations, it is not enough for some OpenCL drivers, which will output isolated NaN (Not a Number) values. These NaN values may be subsequently spread by local filters (blurring and sharpening operations, like sharpness, local contrast, contrast equalizer, low pass, high pass, surface blur, and filmic highlights reconstruction), resulting in large black, gray or white squares.\nIn all these cases, you must enable the \u0026ldquo;clip negative RGB from gamut\u0026rdquo; option in the color calibration module.\nNote 2: A common case for failure of the color algorithms in color calibration (especially the gamut compression) is pixels that have a luminance value of 0 (Y channel of the CIE 1931 XYZ space), but non-zero chromaticity values (X and Z channels of the CIE 1931 XYZ space). This case is a numerical oddity that matches no physical reality (a pixel with no luminance should have no chromaticity either), will produce a division by zero in xyY and Yuv color spaces, and will create NaN RGB values as a result. This issue is not corrected inside color calibration because it is a symptom of a bad input profiling and/or a bad black point level, and needs to be addressed manually either by adjusting the input color profile with the channel mixer or in the exposure module\u0026rsquo;s black level correction.\n🔗CAT warnings The chromatic adaptation in this module relies on a number of assumptions about the earlier processing steps in the pipeline in order to work correctly, and it can be easy to inadvertently break those assumptions in subtle ways. To help you to avoid these kinds of mistakes, the color calibration module will show warnings in the following circumstances.\nIf the color calibration module is set up to perform chromatic adaptation but the white balance module is not set to \u0026ldquo;camera reference\u0026rdquo;, warnings will be shown in both modules. These errors can be resolved either by setting the white balance module to \u0026ldquo;camera reference\u0026rdquo; or by disabling chromatic adaptation in the color calibration module. Note that some sensors may require minor corrections within the white balance module in which case these warnings can be ignored.\nIf two or more instances of color calibration have been created, each attempting to perform chromatic adaptation, an error will be shown on the second instance. This could be a valid use case (for instance where masks have been set up to apply different white balances to different non-overlapping areas of the image) in which case the warnings can be ignored. For most other cases, chromatic adaptation should be disabled in one of the instances to avoid double-corrections.\nBy default, if an instance of the color calibration module is already performing chromatic adaptation, each new instance you create will automatically have its adaptation set to \u0026ldquo;none (bypass)\u0026rdquo; to avoid this \u0026ldquo;double-correction\u0026rdquo; error.\nThe chromatic adaptation modes in color calibration can be disabled by either setting the adaptation to \u0026ldquo;none (bypass)\u0026rdquo; or setting the illuminant to \u0026ldquo;same as pipeline (D50)\u0026rdquo; in the CAT tab.\nThese warnings are intended to prevent common and easy mistakes while using the automatic default presets in the module in a typical RAW editing workflow. When using custom presets and some specific workflows, such as editing film scans or JPEGs, these warnings can and should be ignored.\nAdvanced users can disable module warnings in preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; show warning messages.\n🔗channel mixing The remainder of this module is a standard channel mixer, allowing you to adjust the output R, G, B, colorfulness, brightness and gray of the module based on the relative strengths of the R, G and B input channels.\nChannel mixing is performed in the color space defined by the adaptation control on the CAT tab. For all practical purposes, these CAT spaces are particular RGB spaces tied to human physiology and proportional to the light emissions in the scene, but they still behave in the same way as any other RGB space. The use of any of the CAT spaces can make the channel mixer tuning process easier, due to their connection with human physiology, but it is also possible to mix channels in the RGB working space of the pipeline by setting the adaptation to \u0026ldquo;none (bypass)\u0026rdquo;. To perform channel mixing in one of the adaptation color spaces without chromatic adaptation, set the illuminant to \u0026ldquo;same as pipeline (D50)\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: The actual colors of the CAT or RGB primaries used for the channel mixing, projected to sRGB display space, are painted in the background of the RGB sliders, so you can get a sense of the color shift that will result from your altered settings.\nChannel mixing is a process that defines a boosting/muting factor for each channel as a ratio of all the original channels. Instead of entering a single flat correction that ties the output value of a channel to its input value (for example, R_output = R_input × correction), the correction to each channel is dependent on the input of all of the channels for each pixel (for example, R_output = R_input × R_correction + G_input × G_correction + B_input × B_correction). Thus a pixel\u0026rsquo;s channels contribute to each other (a process known as \u0026ldquo;cross-talk\u0026rdquo;) which is equivalent to rotating the primary colors of the color space in 3D. This is, in effect, digital simulation of physical color filters.\nAlthough rotating primary colors in 3D is ultimately equivalent to applying a general hue rotation, the connection between the RGB corrections and the resulting perceptual hue rotation is not directly predictable, which makes the process non-intuitive. \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; should be taken as a mixture of 3 lights that we dial up and down, not as a set of colors or hues. Also, since RGB tristimulus does not decouple luminance and chrominance, but is an additive lighting setup, the \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; channel is more strongly tied to human luminance perception than the \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; ones. All pixels have a non-zero G channel, which implies that any correction to the G channel is likely to affect all pixels.\nThe channel mixing process is therefore tied to a physical interpretation of the RGB tristimulus (as additive lights), which makes it well-suited for primary color grading and illuminant corrections, and blends the color changes smoothly. However, trying to understand and predict it from a perceptual point of view (luminance, hue and saturation) is going to fail and is discouraged.\nNote: The \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; labels on the channels of the color spaces in this module are merely conventions formed out of habit. These channels do not necessarily look \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;, and users are advised against trying to make sense out of them based on their names. This is a general principle that applies to any RGB space used in any application.\n🔗R, G and B tabs At its most basic level, you can think of the R, G and B tabs of the color calibration module as a type of matrix multiplication between a 3x3 matrix and the input [R G B] values. This is in fact very similar to what a matrix-based ICC color profile does, except that the user can input the matrix coefficients via the darktable GUI rather than reading the coefficients from an ICC profile file.\n┌ R_out ┐ ┌ Rr Rg Rb ┐ ┌ R_in ┐ │ G_out │ = │ Gr Gg Gb │ X │ G_in │ └ B_out ┘ └ Br Bg Bb ┘ └ B_in ┘ If, for example, you\u0026rsquo;ve been provided with a matrix to transform from one color space to another, you can enter the matrix coefficients into the channel mixer as follows:\nselect the R tab and then set the Rr, Rg \u0026amp; Rb values using the R, G and B input sliders select the G tab and then set the Gr, Gg \u0026amp; Gb values using the R, G and B input sliders select the B tab and then set the Br, Bg \u0026amp; Bb values using the R, G and B input sliders By default, the mixing function in color calibration just copies the input [R G B] channels straight over to the matching output channels. This is equivalent to multiplying by the identity matrix:\n┌ R_out ┐ ┌ 1 0 0 ┐ ┌ R_in ┐ │ G_out │ = │ 0 1 0 │ X │ G_in │ └ B_out ┘ └ 0 0 1 ┘ └ B_in ┘ For a more intuitive understanding of how the mixing sliders on the R, G and B tabs behave, consider the following:\nfor the R destination channel, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more \u0026ldquo;cyan\u0026rdquo;. for the G destination channel, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo;. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more \u0026ldquo;magenta\u0026rdquo;. for the B destination channel, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more \u0026ldquo;yellow\u0026rdquo;. 🔗R, G and B tab controls The following controls are shown for each of the R, G and B tabs:\ninput R/G/B Choose how much the input R, G and B channels influence the output channel relating to the tab concerned. normalize channels Select this checkbox to normalize the coefficients to try to preserve the overall brightness of this channel in the final image as compared to the input image. 🔗brightness and colorfulness tabs The brightness and colorfulness (color saturation) of pixels in an image can also be adjusted based on the R, G and B input channels. This uses the same basic algorithm that the filmic rgb module uses for tone mapping (which preserves RGB ratios) and for mid-tones saturation (which massages them).\nsaturation algorithm This control allows you to upgrade the saturation algorithm to the new 2021 version, for edits produced prior to darktable 3.6 \u0026ndash; it will not appear for edits that already use the latest version. 🔗colorfulness tab controls input R/G/B Adjust the color saturation of pixels, based on the R, G and B channels of those pixels. For example, adjusting the input R slider will affect the color saturation of pixels containing a lot of \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; more than pixels containing only a small amount of \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;. normalize channels Select this checkbox to try to keep the overall saturation constant between the input and output images. 🔗brightness tab controls input R/G/B Adjust the brightness of certain colors in the image, based on the R, G and B channels of those colors. For example, adjusting the input R slider will affect the brightness of colors containing a lot of R channel much more than colors containing only a small amount of R channel. When darkening/brightening a pixel, the ratio of the R, G and B channels for that pixel is maintained, in order to preserve the hue. normalize channels Select this checkbox to try to keep the overall brightness constant between the input and output images. 🔗gray tab Another very useful application of color calibration is the ability to mix the channels together to produce a grayscale output \u0026ndash; a monochrome image. Select the gray tab, and set the R, G and B sliders to control how much each channel contributes to the brightness of the output. This is equivalent to the following matrix multiplication:\nGRAY_out = [ r g b ] X ┌ R_in ┐ │ G_in │ └ B_in ┘ When dealing with skin tones, the relative weights of the three channels will affect the level of detail in the image. Placing more weight on R (e.g. [0.9, 0.3, -0.3]) will make for smooth skin tones, whereas emphasising G (e.g. [0.4, 0.75, -0.15]) will bring out more detail. In both cases the B channel is reduced to avoid emphasising unwanted skin texture.\n🔗gray tab controls input R/G/B Choose how much each of the R, G and B channels contribute to the gray level of the output. The image will only be converted to monochrome if the three sliders add up to some non-zero value. Adding more B will tend to bring out more details, adding more R will tend to smooth skin tones. normalize channels Select this checkbox to try to keep the overall brightness constant as the sliders are adjusted. 🔗area color mapping The area mapping feature is designed to help with batch-editing a series of images in an efficient way. In this scenario, you typically develop a single reference image for the whole batch and then copy\u0026amp;paste the development stack to all of the other images in the batch.\nUnfortunately, the color temperature of the illuminating light often changes slightly between shots, even within the same series captured in the same conditions. This can be the result of a cloud passing by the sun in natural light, or a different ratio between colored bounce light and main light. Each image will still need some individual fine-tuning if you want a perfectly even look over the whole series, and this can be both time-consuming and frustrating.\nArea color mapping allows you to define a target chromaticity (hue and chroma) for a particular region of the image (the control sample), which you then match against the same target chromaticity in other images. The control sample can either be a critical part of your subject that needs to have constant color, or a non-moving and consistently-lit surface over your series of images.\nThe mapping process consists of two steps.\n🔗step 1: set the target There are two ways of setting the target chromaticity for your control sample:\nif you know or expect an arbitrary color for the control sample (for example, a gray card, a color chart, a product or a logo of a specified color), you can set its L, h and c values directly, in Lch derived from CIE Lab 1976 space, if you simply want to match the development of your reference image, set the area mode to measure, then enable the picker (to the right of the color patch) and draw a rectangle over your control sample. The input column will then be updated with the L, h, c values of the control sample before the color correction, and the target column will show the resulting L, h, c values of the control sample after the current calibration setting is applied. If you reset the L, h, c values, the default value is a neutral color at 50% lightness (middle-gray) \u0026ndash; this can be useful to quickly set the average white balance of any image. If you want to match the control sample against neutral gray, you only need to reset the chroma slider because the lightness and hue settings have no effect on chromaticity for neutral grays.\nNote that the target value is not reset when you reset the module itself, but is stored indefinitely in darktable\u0026rsquo;s configuration and will be available on next launch as well as for the next image you develop. Additionally, the position of the selected rectangle is also stored for ease of use when applying the picked correction value to multiple similar images (see below under \u0026ldquo;match the target\u0026rdquo;), though you may redraw the rectangle if the position of the target object changes between images.\nThe take channel mixing into account option lets you choose where the target is sampled. If disabled, the target color is measured immediately after the CAT (Chromatic Adaptation Transform) step, which takes place before any channel mixing. This means that if you have a calibrated profile in effect within the channel mixer, this profile will be discarded. If enabled, the target color is measured after the CAT and the channel mixing steps, including any calibrated profile. This is the recommended option for most use cases.\nNote: If you are defining your target from a gray patch, you should know that the gray patch on color checkers is never entirely neutral. For example, Datacolor Spyder has a slightly warm gray (hue = 20°, chroma = 1.2) while X-Rite pre-2014 has a colder but more neutral gray (hue = 240°, chroma = 0.3) and X-Rite post-2014 is almost perfectly neutral (hue = 133°, chroma = 0.2). In general, it is not desirable to match the control sample against a perfectly neutral gray target, and it is actually wrong to do so when using gray cards and color checkers as a control sample.\n🔗step 2 : match the target When you open a new image, the area mode is automatically reset to correction. Using the picker attached to the color patch, you can then directly reselect your control sample in the new image. The proper illuminant settings required for the control sample to match the memorized target chromaticity will be automatically computed, and the setting will be updated in the same operation.\nThe take channel mixing into account option will need to be set the same as when the measurement of the target was performed to ensure consistent results. Note that the target matching only defines the illuminant settings used in the Chromatic Adaptation Transform \u0026ndash; it does not alter the channel mixer settings, since the calibration is handled in the color checker calibration tool. However, the channel mixer settings can be used or discarded in the computation of the illuminant settings, depending on this option.\nThis operation can be repeated as many times as you have images in your series with no further work.\n🔗step 3: deactivate color mapping The settings you configured in step 1 are \u0026ldquo;sticky\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; they will stay active until you manually turn them off by resetting lightness to 50 and chroma to 0. Until then, every time you use this module (even after closing and restarting darktable), those settings will affect the results of an auto-whitebalance operation. To remind you that color mapping is active, especially while the section is collapsed, the heading will change from \u0026ldquo;area color mapping\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;area color mapping (active)\u0026rdquo; whenever chroma is nonzero or lightness is other than 50.\nNote: Perfectly matching your control sample against the target chromaticity may still not yield a similar perceptual result, even if the numbers are exactly the same. The ratio of lightness between the control sample and its surrounding, as well as the color contrasts at play in the frame, will alter the perception of colors in ways that are very difficult to model. To build an intuition of this problem, see the gray strawberries illusion.\n🔗extracting settings using a color checker Since the channel mixer is essentially an RGB matrix (similar to the input color profile used for RAW images) it can be used to improve the color accuracy of the input color profile by computing ad-hoc color calibration settings.\nThese computed settings aim to minimize the color difference between the scene reference and the camera recording in a given lighting situation. This is equivalent to creating a generic ICC color profile but here, the profile is instead stored as module settings that can be saved as presets or styles, to be shared and reused between images. Such profiles are meant to complement and refine the generic input profile but do not replace it.\nThis feature can assist with:\nhandling difficult illuminants, such as low CRI light bulbs, for which a mere white balancing will never suffice, digitizing artworks or commercial products where an accurate rendition of the original colors is required, neutralizing a number of different cameras to the same ground-truth, in multi-camera photo sessions, in order to obtain a consistent base look and share the color editing settings with a consistent final look, obtaining a sane color pipeline from the start, nailing white balance and removing any bounced-light color cast at once, with minimal effort and time. 🔗supported color checker targets Users are not currently permitted to use custom targets, but a limited number of verified color checkers (from reputable manufacturers) are supported:\nX-Rite / Gretag MacBeth Color Checker 24 (pre- and post-2014), Datacolor SpyderCheckr 24 (pre- and post-2018), Datacolor SpyderCheckr 48 (pre- and post-2018), Datacolor SpyderCheckr Photo. Users are discouraged from obtaining cheap, off-brand, color targets as color constancy between batches cannot possibly be asserted at such prices. Inaccurate color checkers will only defeat the purpose of color calibration and possibly make things worse.\nIT7 and IT8 charts are not supported since they are hardly portable and not practical for use on-location for ad-hoc profiles. These charts are better suited for creating generic color profiles, undertaken using a standard illuminant, for example with Argyll CMS.\nNote: X-Rite changed the formula of their pigments in 2014 and Datacolor in 2018, which slightly altered the color of the patches. Both formulas are supported in darktable, but you should be careful to choose the correct reference for your target. If in doubt, try both and choose the one that yields the lowest average delta E after calibration.\n🔗prerequisites In order to use this feature you will need to take a test shot of a supported color checker chart, on-location, under appropriate lighting conditions:\nframe the chart in the center 50% of the camera\u0026rsquo;s field, to ensure that the image is free of vignetting, ensure that the main light source is far enough from the chart to give an even lighting field over the surface of the chart, adjust the angle between the light, chart and lens to prevent reflections and gloss on the color patches, for the best quality profile you should capture an image with the appropriate brightness. To achieve this, take a few bracketed images (between -1 and +1 EV) of your color checker and load them into darktable, ensuring that all modules between color calibration and output color profile are disabled. Choose the image where the white patch has a brightness L of 94-96% in CIE Lab space or a luminance Y of 83-88% in CIE XYZ space (use the global color picker). This step is not strictly necessary \u0026ndash; alternatively you can take a single image and apply the exposure compensation as recommended in the profile report. If the lighting conditions are close to a standard D50 to D65 illuminant (direct natural light, no colored bounced light), the color checker shot can be used to produce a generic profile that will be suitable for any daylight illuminant with only a slight adjustment of the white balance.\nIf the lighting conditions are peculiar and far from standard illuminants, the color checker shot will be only usable as an ad-hoc profile for images taken in the same lighting conditions.\n🔗usage The settings used in color calibration depend on the chosen CAT space and on any color settings defined earlier in the pipe within the white balance and input color profile modules. As such, the results of the profiling (e.g. the RGB channel mixing coefficients) are valid only for a rigid set of CAT space, white balance and input color profile settings. If you wish to create a generic style with your profile, don\u0026rsquo;t forget that you will need to include the settings from these modules as well.\nUse the following process to create your profile preset/style:\nEnable the lens correction module to correct any vignetting that might mislead the calibration, On the bottom of the color calibration module, click on the arrow near the calibrate with a color checker label, to show the controls, Pick the correct model and manufacturer of your color checker from the chart drop-down, In the image preview, an overlay of the chart\u0026rsquo;s patches will appear. Drag the corners of the chart so that they match the visual references (dots or crosses) around the target, to compensate for any perspective distortion, Click the refresh button to compute the profile, Check the Profile quality report. If it is \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;, you can click on the validation button. If not, try changing the optimization strategy and refresh the profile again. Save the profile in a preset or style, or simply copy \u0026amp; paste the module settings to all of the images taken under the same lighting conditions, from within the lighttable view or filmstrip. Note: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to use the standard matrix in the input color profile module when performing a calibration, but be aware that the \u0026ldquo;as shot in camera\u0026rdquo; default white balance will not work properly with any other profile, and that you will need to always use the same input profile whenever you reuse such calibration settings.\n🔗reading the profile report The profile report helps you to assess the quality of the calibration. The settings in color calibration are only a \u0026ldquo;best fit\u0026rdquo; optimization and will never be 100% accurate for the whole color spectrum. We therefore need to track \u0026ldquo;how inaccurate\u0026rdquo; it is in order to know whether we can trust this profile or not.\nBad profiles can happen and will do more harm than good if used.\n🔗delta E and the quality report The CIE delta E 2000 (ΔE) is used as a perceptual metric of the error between the reference color of the patches and the color obtained after each step of calibration:\nΔE = 0 means that there is no error \u0026ndash; the obtained color is exactly the reference color. Unfortunately, this will never happen in practice. ΔE = 2.3 is defined as the Just Noticeable Difference (JND). ΔE \u0026lt; 2.3 means that the average observer will not be able to tell the difference between the expected reference color and the obtained color. This is a satisfactory result. ΔE \u0026gt; 2.3 means that the color difference between the expected reference and the obtained color is noticeable for the average observer. This is unsatisfactory but sometimes unavoidable. The quality report tracks the average and maximum ΔE at the input of the module (before anything is done), after the chromatic adaptation step (white balance only), and at the output of the module (white balance and channel mixing). At each step, the ΔE should be lower than at the previous step, if everything goes as planned.\n🔗profile data The data generated by the profiling process comprises the RGB 3×3 matrix and the detected illuminant. These are expressed in the CAT adaptation space defined in the CAT tab and are provided in case you want to export these coefficients to other software. If the detected illuminant is daylight or black body, the matrix should be fairly generic and reusable for other daylight and black body illuminants with the addition of a small white balance adjustment.\n🔗normalization values These are the settings that you should define, as-is, for the exposure and black level correction parameters in the exposure module, in order to obtain the lowest possible error in your profile. This step is optional and is useful only when the utmost precision is required, but beware that it can produce negative RGB values that will be clipped at various points in the pipeline.\n🔗overlay The chart overlay displays a disc in the center of each color patch, which represents the expected reference value of that patch, projected into the display RGB space. This helps you to visually assess the difference between the reference and the actual color without having to bother with ΔE values. This visual clue will be reliable only if you set the exposure module as instructed in the normalization values of the profile report.\nOnce the profile has been calibrated, some of the square patches will be crossed in the background by one or two diagonals:\npatches that are not crossed have ΔE \u0026lt; 2.3 (JND), meaning they are accurate enough that the average observer will be unable to notice the deviation, patches crossed with one diagonal have 2.3 \u0026lt; ΔE \u0026lt; 4.6, meaning that they are mildly inaccurate, patches crossed with two diagonals have ΔE \u0026gt; 4.6 (2 × JND), meaning that they are highly inaccurate. This visual feedback will help you to set up the optimization trade-off to check which colors are more or less accurate.\n🔗enhancing the profile Because any calibration is merely a \u0026ldquo;best fit\u0026rdquo; optimization (using a weighted least-squares method) it is impossible to have all patches within our ΔE \u0026lt; 2.3 tolerance. Some compromise will therefore be required.\nThe optimize for parameter allows you to define an optimization strategy that attempts to increase the profile accuracy in some colors at the expense of others. The following options are available:\nnone: Don\u0026rsquo;t use an explicit strategy but rely on the implicit strategy defined by the color checker manufacturer. For example, if the color checker has mostly low-saturation patches, the profile will be more accurate for less-saturated colors. neutral colors: Give priority to grays and less-saturated colors. This is useful for desperate cases involving cheap fluorescent and LED lightings, having low CRI. However, it may increase the error in highly-saturated colors more than not having any profile. saturated colors: Give priority to primary colors and highly-saturated colors. This is useful in product and commercial photography, to get brand colors right. skin and soil colors, foliage colors, sky and water colors: Give priority to the chosen hue range. This is useful if the subject of your images is clearly defined and has a typical color. average delta E: Attempt to make the color error uniform across the color range and minimize the average perceptual error. This is useful for generic profiles. maximum delta E: Attempt to minimize outliers and large errors, at the expense of the average error. This can be useful to get highly saturated blues back into line. No matter what you do, strategies that favor a low average ΔE will usually have a higher maximum ΔE, and vice versa. Also, blues are always the more challenging color range to get correct, so the calibration usually falls back to protecting blues at the expense of everything else, or everything else at the expense of blues.\nThe ease of obtaining a proper calibration depends on the quality of the scene illuminant (daylight and high CRI illuminants should always be preferred), the quality of the primary input color profile, the black point compensation set in the exposure module, but first and foremost on the mathematical properties of the camera sensor\u0026rsquo;s filter array.\n🔗profile checking It is possible to use the color space check button (first on the left, at the bottom of the module) to perform a single ΔE computation of the color checker reference against the output of the color calibration module. This can be used in the following ways:\nTo check the accuracy of a profile calculated in particular conditions against a color checker shot in different conditions. To evaluate the performance of any color correction performed earlier in the pipe, by setting the color calibration parameters to values that effectively disable it (CAT adaptation to none, everything else set to default), and just use the average ΔE as a performance metric. 🔗caveats The ability to use standard CIE illuminants and CCT-based interfaces to define the illuminant color depends on sound default values for the standard matrix in the input color profile module as well as reasonable RGB coefficients in the white balance module.\nSome cameras, most notably those from Olympus and Sony, have unexpected white balance coefficients that will always make the detected CCT invalid even for legitimate daylight scene illuminants. This error most likely comes from issues with the standard input matrix, which is taken from the Adobe DNG Converter.\nIt is possible to alleviate this issue, if you have a computer screen calibrated for a D65 illuminant, using the following process:\nDisplay a white surface on your screen, for example by opening a blank canvas in any photo editing software you like Take a blurry (out of focus) image of that surface with your camera, ensuring that you don\u0026rsquo;t have any \u0026ldquo;parasite\u0026rdquo; light in the frame, you have no clipping, and are using an aperture between f/5.6 and f/8, Open the image in darktable and extract the white balance by using the picker tool in the white balance module on the center area of the image (non-central regions might be subject to chromatic aberrations). This will generate a set of 3 RGB coefficients. Save a preset for the white balance module with these coefficients and auto-apply it to any color RAW image created by the same camera.

Specifically, the color zones module is prone to increase chroma/luma noise, and introduce artifacts or harsh transitions. These are somewhat mitigated within color equalizer with the following additions:\na fixed number of equally-spaced adjustment nodes means a smoother adjustment curve a guided filter is used, which attempts to smooth out changes by taking into account both the hue of the neighboring pixels and their overall saturation The provided tabs can be used (either individually or in combination) to adjust the hue, saturation, and/or brightness at each of the color nodes. While the distance between nodes cannot be changed (see above), if you wish to target a specific hue that does not currently lie on a node, the \u0026ldquo;node placement\u0026rdquo; slider can be used to move all of the nodes simultaneously. The picker can be used to display the color of a \u0026ldquo;picked\u0026rdquo; pixel or area on the curve adjustment section of the module to allow specific colors to be targeted.\nNote: While the above mitigations can reduce the noise/artifacts generated by this module, they will not always be entirely successful, and you are therefore advised to use this module with care. Try not to make very large changes, and look at some of the options for tweaking the guided filter (below) if introduced noise is excessive.\n🔗module controls 🔗hue/saturation/brightness adjustment curves The main controls of this module are the hue/saturation/brightness adjustment curves. Use each of these tabs to adjust the hue, saturation, or brightness of pixels based on their current hue. Click and drag the color nodes (up/down) to alter the properties of pixels with the given hue. You can also adjust nodes using the scroll wheel on your mouse and, as with sliders, you can change the speed of the adjustment by combining the scroll with Ctrl (to adjust more slowly) or Shift (to adjust more quickly).\nYou can also adjust the color nodes using sliders, which can be shown/hidden by middle-clicking on the curve adjustment section of the module with your mouse.\nAs with sliders, you can also right-click on a node/slider to perform fine adjustments (see module controls/sliders for more details).\nUse the picker to choose a pixel or area on the image and show the hue of that pixel/area on the adjustment curve.\nnode placement Adjust the position of all of the nodes simultaneously (move them left/right). Note: The slider color names will not change when you move the nodes with the \u0026ldquo;node placement\u0026rdquo; slider.\n🔗options 🔗general white level Set the upper bound of brightness corrections that can be made with the module \u0026ndash; the module will not allow brightness of any pixels to be greater than this value. Use the picker to set based on a point/area on the image. This should usually be kept at its default value. hue curve (N/A for saturation/brightness curves) Control how the hue adjustment curve is interpolated between nodes. Values greater than 1 make the transitions between the nodes more gradual. Values less than 1 create sharper transitions, allowing for more precise adjustments to individual hues, while affecting neighbouring areas/colors less. Be aware that lower values can increase the likelihood of introducing noise or artifacts. 🔗guided filter In order to reduce the amount of noise/artifacts, this module uses a guided filter by default. The guided filter attempts to smooth out changes by taking into account both the hue of the neighboring pixels and their overall saturation. This guided filter is ultimately a compromise between adjustment precision (targeting colors more specifically) and avoidance of artifacts (which will generally require less precise targeting). The following options allow the guided filter to be adjusted and visualised in order to better manage these compromises:\nuse guided filter Toggle the guided filter on/off. hue analysis radius Choose how much to take neighboring pixels into account when accounting for hue in the guided filter. The default value (1.5px) is a compromise intended to ensure that individual \u0026ldquo;noisy\u0026rdquo; pixels (whose color differs significantly from their neighbors) don\u0026rsquo;t become more noisy as a result of any adjustments. Increase this value to smooth out any introduced noise (such as Moiré). However, be aware that very large values can cause halos and other artifacts at edges. saturation threshold Since this module is intended to perform operations based on a pixel\u0026rsquo;s hue, it is usually desirable to restrict its operation to only those pixels that have the highest saturation (and for it to have more of an effect on more highly-saturated pixels). The saturation threshold can be used to choose how saturated a pixel must be before its properties can be adjusted by the module. Decrease to allow adjustment of less-saturated pixels. Increase to restrict adjustment of less-saturated pixels. visualize weighting function (saturation) The first \u0026ldquo;visualization\u0026rdquo; button (to the right of the \u0026ldquo;saturation threshold\u0026rdquo; slider) can be used to see which pixels might be impacted by the operation of this module, based on their saturation, and by how much. Pixels with lower saturation, which will not be adjusted, are shown in shades of blue. Pixels with higher saturation, which might be adjusted (depending on the adjustment curves), are shown in shades of red. The more saturated the red/blue, the more/less (respectively) a pixel will be affected by any adjustment. This visualization only depends on a pixel\u0026rsquo;s saturation, and will not change when you alter the hue/saturation/brightness adjustment curves. It is also affected by the \u0026ldquo;contrast\u0026rdquo; setting (below).\ncontrast Regulate the steepness of the saturation adjustment curve. This is used in conjunction with the \u0026ldquo;saturation threshold\u0026rdquo; slider to determine how much a pixel might be adjusted based on its saturation. The generated curve is shown overlaid on the image when the \u0026ldquo;visualise weighting function\u0026rdquo; button is toggled. Positive values result in a steeper transition (highly-saturated pixels are more likely to be changed, low-saturation pixels are less likely to be changed). Negative values result in a shallower transition (highly-saturated pixels are less likely to be changed, low-saturation pixels are more likely to be changed) effect radius Set the radius of the applied parameters in the guided filter. Larger values will smooth the effects of any adjustments, and will better retain pre-existing detail within the image, though can cause bleeding at edges that will need to be mitigated by other means. visualize changed output for the selected tab The second \u0026ldquo;visualization\u0026rdquo; button (to the right of the \u0026ldquo;effect radius\u0026rdquo; slider) can be used to visualize the overall effect of the adjustments made in the current tab, taking into account both the guided filter and the adjustment curve. Red pixels indicate where the value of the chosen adjustment (hue/saturation/brightness) has increased. Blue pixels indicate where the value of the adjustment has decreased.

The colors of the source image are then mapped to corresponding colors on the target image.\nTwo steps are required to use this module:\nOpen the source image in the darkroom view and acquire its color characteristics by pressing the “acquire as source” button. A set of color clusters is generated and displayed in the “source clusters” area. Each cluster is represented by a set of color swatches with the mean value in the center surrounded by swatches indicating the variance within that cluster. The clusters are sorted in ascending order by their weight (the number of pixels that contribute to each of them). Open the target image in the darkroom view.

A set of sliders gives you control of the effect\u0026rsquo;s strength. You can also use the normal blend mode along with the opacity slider to tame the effect. As the color mapping module comes early in the pixelpipe, you can also finetune the colors with later modules.\n🔗module controls acquire as source/target Press these buttons to generate color clusters for the source and target image, respectively. The processing takes a few seconds during which the GUI will be unresponsive. number of clusters The number of color clusters to use. This should roughly correlate to the number of dominant colors in the image. The clusters are acquired through a statistical sampling process to represent the colors that occur most commonly throughout the image. The random nature of the sampling process means that you might get different results each time you acquire the clusters, especially if you have a larger number of clusters and/or a complex color palette in the image. If you change this parameter all the collected color clusters are reset and must be re-acquired. color dominance This parameter controls the mapping between source and target clusters. At the minimum value, the mapping is based on color proximity. This typically leads to very subtle effects on the target image. At the maximum value, the mapping is based on the relative weight of the color clusters – dominant colors of the source image are mapped to dominant colors of the target image. This typically leads to a very strong effect. Intermediate values incrementally shift between these extremes. histogram equalization Modify the target image\u0026rsquo;s contrast by matching its histogram with the histogram of the source image. This slider controls the extent of this effect.

Most frequently they appear neutral white or exhibit some color cast, depending on what other image processing steps are involved. This module can be used to “heal” overexposed highlights by replacing their colors with better fitting ones. The module acts on pixels whose luminance exceeds a user-defined threshold. Replacement colors are taken from neighboring pixels. Both the spatial distance and the luminance distance (range) are taken into account for color selection.\nDue to a limitation of the underlying algorithm, reconstructed colors may sometimes be displayed incorrectly if you zoom into the image in the darkroom view.

Only pixels with luminance values below the threshold are taken as valid source pixels for replacement colors. Setting this parameter too high will cause the module to have no effect on any pixels. Setting it too low will minimize the “pool” of replacement colors \u0026ndash; if no suitable colors are available, the original colors are retained. This parameter therefore exhibits a “sweet spot” characteristic with an optimum setting depending on the individual image. spatial extent The spatial distance that source pixels may have from target pixels in order for them to contribute to color replacement. Higher values cause ever more distant pixels to contribute. This increases the chance of finding a replacement color but can make the replacement color less well suited for the reconstruction. range extent The range difference (in luminance) that source pixels may have from target pixels in order for them to contribute to color replacement. Higher values cause more pixels to contribute even if their luminance differs more strongly from the target pixels. This again increases the chance of finding a replacement color but at the same time increases the risk of unfitting colors creeping in. precedence This combobox defines whether certain replacement colors shall take precedence over others as follows: off (default): All pixels contribute equally saturated colors: Pixels contribute according to their chromaticity \u0026ndash; the more highly-saturated a color, the more it contributes hue: Give precedence to a specific hue (see below) hue This slider is only visible if you set the precedence to “hue”. It allows you to select a preferred hue for replacement colors. This only has an effect if the preferred hue is actually present within the selected spatial and range distance of the target pixels (see above). A typical use case is repairing highlights on human skin in situations where diverging colors are in close proximity (e.g. textiles or hair with a luminance close that of to skin). Setting a hue preference on skin tones prevents these other colors from creeping in.

It allows you to manipulate the lightness, chroma and hue of targeted groups of pixels through the use of curves.\nYou first need to choose whether you wish to adjust (select) pixels based on their lightness, chroma or hue. You can then use three curves, on their respective tabs, to adjust the lightness, chroma and hue of ranges of pixels selected via this method.\nNote: This module should be used with care, as transitions between colors may not be graceful. Instead, use the color balance rgb module with a parametric mask.\n🔗pixel selection method The color zones module offers three different methods for selecting which pixels you want to adjust. They are:\nselect by hue (default) Select pixels to manipulate based on their hue. For example, you may want to darken a blue sky, or to change a red porche into a yellow one. The following image shows the full range of hues that you can choose to operate on: select by lightness Select pixels to manipulate based on their lightness. For example, you may want to make your shadows brighter, or to make your highlights more yellow. The following image shows the range of lightness levels that you can choose to operate on, from dark to light: select by chroma Select pixels to manipulate based on their chroma. For example, you may want to tone down the chroma of some already highly saturated pixels, or to change their hue. The following image shows the range of chroma levels that you can choose to operate on, from a completely unsaturated monochrome gray through to the most highly saturated color: 🔗pixel manipulation curves Once you have chosen a pixel selection method, the selected range of lightness, chroma or hue levels will appear along the horizontal axis of the three pixel manipulation curves, which can be viewed and adjusted by choosing the appropriate tab (lightness, chroma, hue).\nIf, for example, you were to choose to select by hue (the default), the horizontal axis (below the manipulation curves) would show the range of hues you can work with, and the three pixel manipulation curves would appears as follows:\nlightness By adjusting the lightness curve up or down in a given (hue) location, you can brighten or darken pixels matching hues where the curve has been raised or lowered, respectively. The example below reduces the lightness of the blue parts of the image: chroma By adjusting the chroma curve up or down in a given (hue) location, you can desaturate (make less colorful) or resaturate (make more colorful) pixels matching hues where the curve has been raised or lowered, respectively. The example below reduces the chroma of the red parts of the image: hue By adjusting the hue curve up or down in a given (hue) location, you can shift the hue of pixels matching hues where the curve has been raised or lowered, allowing you to replace one color with another. The example below shifts the blue parts of the image to green: The curves work similarly in the lightness- and chroma-based selection modes as well. See the section on curves to see how spline curves work in general.\nNote that these examples are somewhat contrived in order to illustrate the module\u0026rsquo;s usage. In practical use, they would likely need to be combined with drawn and/or parametric masks to further isolate their effect.\n🔗range selection When adjusting the pixel manipulation curves, it can sometimes be difficult to judge exactly where on the horizontal axis pixels will fall. To the right of the tab controls are a pair of pickers that can be used to assist with this.\nIf you click the left-hand picker and choose a pixel in the image, you will see a dark vertical line showing where that pixel falls on the horizontal axis. If you Ctrl+click or right-click on the same picker you can choose a rectangular area from the image \u0026ndash; the range of values represented within the selected rectangle will be shaded vertically, with a similar dark line showing the median value.\nIf you click on the right-hand picker, you can similarly choose a rectangular area on the image and the display will be shown as described above (a shaded area with a dark vertical line). However, in this case the picker will also automatically add some control points to the curve for you, representing the highlighted range (see below). Simply drag on the center node to raise or lower the curve within the selected range. Alternatively, hold Ctrl while selecting a range to automatically create a positive curve (push up the selected range) or hold Shift while selecting to create a negative curve (pushed down).\n🔗module controls The following controls are available in the color zones module:\nlightness, chroma \u0026amp; hue tabs Each tab displays a pixel manipulation curve to allow you to alter “lightness”, “chroma”, or “hue” based on the pixel selection method. edit by area Choose how to interact with the curve. This setting is disabled by default, allowing the control points for the curve to be freely placed. Check the box to fall back to the legacy \u0026ldquo;edit by area\u0026rdquo; mode, which functions in a similar way to the spline curve controls used in wavelet modules. mask display Enable the mask display to highlight pixels that have been affected by color zones adjustments in yellow. select by Define the horizontal axis (the range of values to work on). You can choose between “lightness”, “chroma”, and “hue” (the default). Changing this parameter resets all pixel manipulation curves to their default state (horizontal straight lines). If you want to work on multiple ranges, you need to create additional instances of the module. process mode Choose between a “smooth” (default) or “strong” processing mode. The default mode is less likely to cause artifacts. mix Use this parameter to tune the strength of the overall effect. interpolation method Define how the curve is interpolated using the user-defined control points.

If you wish to include any modules after that point, you should move the composite module within the overlaid image first and complete your edit before dropping it onto your target image. Because the darktable will now be processing two images, this could significantly degrade performance, so try to avoid too many large edits on both images.

The module operates in CIE LCh color space and so is able to treat luminosity and chromaticity independently.\nA number of presets are provided, which should help you to understand the capabilities of the module.\n🔗module controls The contrast equalizer module decomposes the image into various detail scales. On each detail scale, you can independently adjust the contrast and denoise splines for lightness (\u0026ldquo;luma\u0026rdquo;) and chromaticity (“chroma”, or color saturation), as well as adjusting the edge-awareness (“edges”) of the wavelet transform. The luma, chroma and edges splines are provided on separate tabs, and some examples of their usage are given in the following sections.\nBelow the spline graphs is a mix slider, which can be used to adjust the strength of the effect, and even to invert the graph (with negative values). While your mouse is over the spline graph, the curve will be displayed as if the mix slider was set to 1.0, to allow for easier editing. When you move your mouse away, the graph will be re-adjusted to account for the mix slider.\nIn the background of the curve you can see a number of alternating light and dark stripes. These represent the levels of detail that are visible at your current zoom scale \u0026ndash; any details without these stripes are too small to be seen your current view. Adjustments made to control points within the striped section may produce a visible effect (depending on the strength of the adjustment). Adjustments outside of the striped region will not. Zoom in to see higher levels of detail and make adjustments to the more detailed areas of the image.\nTip: if you are having trouble visualising which parts of the curve will affect which details in the image, you can set the blend mode to \u0026ldquo;difference\u0026rdquo;. This will make the image go black except for those areas where the output of the module differs from the input. By raising the curve at one of the control points, you will be able to see which details in the image are represented by that point.\n🔗luma tab The luma tab allows you to adjust the local contrast in the image\u0026rsquo;s luminance (brightness). Adjustments are represented by a white spline that begins as a horizontal line running across the centre of the graph (indicating that no change will be made). Raise or lower this spline at the left end of the graph to increase or decrease the local contrast of coarse detail in the image. Perform similar adjustments towards the right side of the graph to adjust the local contrast of the fine details in the image.\nWhen you hover the mouse pointer over the graph, a white circle indicates the radius of influence of the mouse pointer \u0026ndash; the size of this circle can be adjusted by scrolling with the mouse wheel. The larger the circle of influence, the more control points will be affected when you adjust the curve. A highlighted region in the background shows what the spline would look like if you pushed the currently-hovered control point all the way to the top or bottom on the graph \u0026ndash; see the screenshot below for examples of these features. For more information see the wavelets section.\nThe following image shows the default state of the contrast equalizer module before any adjustments have been made:\nRaising the two control points at the right-hand end of the graph will increase the sharpness of the fine details (the eye and feathers of the bird) while leaving coarser details (the rocks in the background) largely unaffected. The example below has been exaggerated to better illustrate the effect.\nIncreasing the local contrast can also amplify the luma noise in the image. A second spline located at the bottom of the graph can be used to denoise the selected detail scales. Raise this spline (by clicking just above one of the triangles at the bottom of the graph and dragging the line upwards) to reduce noise at the given wavelet scale. In the example above, the dark denoising spline has been raised at the fine-detail end of the graph.\n🔗chroma tab The chroma tab allows the color contrast or saturation to be adjusted at the selected wavelet scales. See the following example:\nSay you wanted to bring out the green color of the anthers at the end of the stamen. The pink petals of the flowers are already quite saturated, but using contrast equalizer you can selectively boost the saturation on the small scale of the anthers without impacting the saturation of the petals. By raising the third control point from the right, you can target the saturation of the anthers only:\nAs in the luma tab, the chroma tab also has a denoising spline at the bottom of the graph. This can be used to handle chroma noise at different scales within the image. Chroma denoising can generally be more aggressive on larger wavelet scales and has less effect on a smaller scale.\n🔗edge tab The basic wavelet à trous transform has been enhanced in the contrast equalizer to be \u0026ldquo;edge-aware\u0026rdquo;, which can help to reduce the gradient reversals and halo artifacts that the basic algorithm can produce. The edges tab does not directly act on the edges in an image; rather it adjusts the edge awareness feature of the wavelet transform. If you have not adjusted the luma or chroma splines, adjusting the edge awareness spline will have no effect.\nTo see the sorts of artifacts that the edges curve tries to combat, here is an example taken from the original paper \u0026ldquo;Edge-Optimized À-Trous Wavelets for Local Contrast Enhancement with Robust Denoising\u0026rdquo; (Hanika, Damertz and Lensch 2011):\nIn the image on the left, the edges spline has been reduced to a minimum, effectively disabling the edge awareness and resulting in halos. In the middle image, the edges spline has been increased too much, resulting in gradient reversals. In the image on the right the edges spline has been set somewhere in between the two extremes, resulting in nice clean edges.\nUsually the default central position of the spline is a good starting point, but if there are objectionable artifacts around the edges, this control can be helpful in mitigating them. Some experimentation will be required.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-equalizer/","tags":null,"title":"contrast equalizer"},{"categories":null,"content":"Crop an image using on-screen guides.\nThis module appears later in the pipeline than the deprecated crop and rotate module, meaning that the full image can remain available for source spots in the retouch module.

A few special aspect ratios deserve explanation: freehand: Crop without any restrictions original image: Retain the aspect ratio of the original image square: Constrains the aspect ratio to be 1:1 golden cut: The golden ratio (1.62:1) You can also enter any other ratio after opening the combobox by typing it in the form of \u0026ldquo;x:y\u0026rdquo; or as a decimal (e.g. \u0026ldquo;0.5\u0026rdquo; to apply a ratio of 2:1).\nThe button beside the aspect combobox allows you to switch between portrait and landscape orientation if you have selected a rectangular aspect ratio.\nIf you want to add an aspect ratio to the pre-defined drop-down list you can do this by including a line of the form \u0026ldquo;plugins/darkroom/clipping/extra_aspect_ratios/foo=x:y\u0026rdquo; in darktable\u0026rsquo;s configuration file $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc. Here \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo; defines the name of the new aspect ratio and “x” and “y” the corresponding numerical values (x and y must be integers). Note that you can only add new entries for ratios not already present in the drop-down list. You can not use fractions as the actual crop size, however you can for the name. For example, if you want an aspect ratio of 1.91:1, add the following to your darktablerc file: plugins/darkroom/clipping/extra_aspect_ratios/1.91:1=191:100\nNote: When resizing an image in freehand mode you may retain the currently-set aspect ratio by holding Shift while dragging on any of the resize controls.\nNote 2: The crop area is retained when changing orientation.\n🔗margins These sliders allow you to directly set how much of the image to crop from each side. They are automatically updated if you move or resize the crop area on the image using the mouse.\nAs this section is rarely used, it is collapsed by default.\nleft The percentage of the image that should be cropped from the left side. right The percentage of the image that should be cropped from the right side. top The percentage of the image that should be cropped from the top. bottom The percentage of the image that should be cropped from the bottom. 🔗guides Tick the box to show guide overlays whenever the module is activated.

In order to obtain a color image, each cell is covered by a colored filter (red, green or blue) that primarily passes light of that color. This means that each photosite (and therefore each \u0026ldquo;pixel\u0026rdquo; of the raw image) only contains information about a single color channel.\nThe array of color filters covering the sensor, known as a color filter array (CFA), is commonly arranged in a mosaic pattern known as a Bayer filter (though other patterns are also used). A demosaic algorithm reconstructs the other color channels by interpolation with data from the neighboring photosites. For further reading see the Wikipedia articles on demosaicing and the Bayer filter.\nDarktable offers several demosaic algorithms, each with its own characteristics. The differences between them are often very subtle and might only be visible while pixel-peeping. However, as the program works on a pixel-by-pixel basis and demosaic generates the base data for the other modules, the choice of the algorithm can have a visually significant effect on the quality of very fine details in the image. This can include the appearance of false maze patterns as well as the rendering quality of colored edges.\nDemosaic interpolation algorithms are often prone to produce artifacts, typically visible as Moiré patterns when zooming into the image. The chosen algorithm might handle pre-existing Moiré- or Maze-like patterns in the raw data in a better or worse way. In these circumstances VNG4 and LMMSE are often more stable.\nThe following demosaic algorithms are available for sensors with Bayer filters:\nPPG used to be darktable\u0026rsquo;s default demosaic algorithm. It is fast, but other algorithms generally yield better results.\nAMaZE and RCD offer better reconstruction of high-frequency content (finer details, edges, stars) but might struggle with color reconstruction overshoots or added noise in areas of low contrast. While AMaZE often retains more high-frequency details it is also more prone to color overshoots than RCD. Since RCD now offers similar performance to PPG, but with better results, it is now the default algorithm.\nLMMSE is better suited for use on high ISO and noisy images than AMaZE or RCD, both of which tend to generate overshooting artifacts when applied to such images. It can also be useful to manage images that exhibit Moiré patterns with other algorithms.\nVNG4 is better suited for use on images with low-frequency content (e.g. low contrast regions such as sky or snow-fields). Compared to AMaZE and RCD, it causes loss of some details but is very stable for maze artifacts. VNG4 is no longer recommended \u0026ndash; for most images, other algorithms provide better results.\nNote: The performance of the demosaic algorithms differs significantly, AMaZE being by far the slowest.\n🔗sensors without bayer filters There are a few cameras whose sensors do not use a Bayer filter. Cameras with an \u0026ldquo;X-Trans\u0026rdquo; sensor have their own set of demosaic algorithms. The default algorithm for X-Trans sensors is Markesteijn 1-pass, which produces fairly good results. For slightly better quality (at the cost of much slower processing), choose Markesteijn 3-pass. Though VNG is faster than Markesteijn 1-pass on some computers, it is prone to artifacts.\nImages from monochrome cameras do not require demosaicing, however, since darktable 5.4 they use this module to support capture sharpening.\n🔗special algorithms passthrough (monochrome) is only useful for cameras that have had the color filter array physically removed from the sensor (e.g. scratched off). Demosaic algorithms usually reconstruct other color channels by interpolation with data from the neighboring pixels. However, if the color filter array is not present, there is nothing to interpolate, so this algorithm simply sets all the color channels to the same value, resulting in a monochrome image. This method avoids the interpolation artifacts that the standard demosaic algorithms might introduce.\nphotosite_color is not meant to be used for image processing. It takes the raw photosite data and presents it as red, blue or green pixels. This is designed for debugging purposes in order to see the raw data and can assist with analysis of errors produced by the other demosaic algorithms.\nmonochrome is only available for monochrome cameras.\n🔗dual demosaic algorithms Some images have areas best demosaiced using an algorithm that preserves high frequency information (like AMaZE or RCD) and other areas that might profit from an algorithm more suited to low frequency content (like VNG4).\nIn dual demosaic algorithms (e.g. RCD + VNG4) the sensor data is demosaiced twice, first by RCD, AMaZE or Markesteijn 3-pass and then by VNG4. Both sets of demosaiced data are retained for subsequent processing.\nThe data from the high frequency algorithm is then analysed for local data change and, using a threshold (there is a bit more of maths involved here), the output image is written pixel-by-pixel for each color channel using data from each demosaic algorithm weighed by the local data change.\nIn general, areas with greater detail are demosaiced by the algorithm best suited to that purpose (RCD, AMaZe, Markesteijn 3-pass) and any flat areas (like blue sky) are demosaiced using the second algorithm (VNG4).\nThe \u0026rsquo;local data change\u0026rsquo; is technically implemented as a gaussian-blurred single channel selection mask calculated from a combination of the threshold value and the pixels\u0026rsquo; luminance.\n🔗selecting the threshold An automatically-calculated threshold is difficult to implement. Instead, the \u0026ldquo;display blending mask\u0026rdquo; button can be used to display the selection mask so you can control the selection of the algorithm manually. The brighter the pixel in the displayed mask, the more the output is taken from the high-frequency algorithm.\n🔗capture sharpen Capture sharpening recovers details lost due to in-camera or lens blurring, which can be caused by diffraction, the anti-aliasing filter or other sources of gaussian-type blur.\nCapture sharpening is performed inside the demosaic module because some parts of the algorithm require raw CFA data. The sharpening itself is performed on demosaiced RGB data and is available for bayer, xtrans and monochrome sensors.\nCapture sharpening is not intended to be used as a general sharpening / local contrast enhancing tool. It should instead be understood as a way to increase micro-contrast in structures with lots of detail, and leads to better results for further processing. Excellent examples would be details of surfaces like wood, brick walls, hair etc.\nPrerequisites for optimal results are:\nDecent white balance parameters (same requirement as for highlight reconstruction or demosaic) \u0026ndash; in very rare cases this could lead to inferior sharpening quality. Low chromatic aberration \u0026ndash; you might want to use the raw chromatic aberrations module to reduce problems \u0026ndash; there will still likely be more and stronger halo artifacts. Acceptable sensor noise, as noise will generally be amplified by capture sharpening (see contrast sensitivity below). Capture sharpening works in an iterative process using specialized gaussian kernels using a different sigma (in the range of 0.0 -\u0026gt; 1.5) for every single pixel location.\n🔗module controls method The demosaic algorithm to use (see above). edge threshold (PPG only) The threshold for an additional median pass. Defaults to “0” which disables median filtering. LMMSE refine (LMMSE only) Refinement steps for use with the LMMSE demosaic algorithm. Median steps average the output. Refinement steps add some recalculation of red and blue channels. While the refinement options work well for luma noise, they may decrease quality on images with heavy chroma noise. color smoothing Activate a number of additional color smoothing passes. Defaults to “off”. match greens In some cameras the green filters have slightly varying properties. This parameter adds an additional equalization step to suppress artifacts. Available options are “disabled”, “local average”, “full average” and “full and local average”. This option is not shown for X-Trans sensors. dual threshold (dual demosaic modes only) Set the contrast threshold for dual demosaic modes. Lower values favor the high frequency demosaic algorithm and higher values favor the low frequency algorithm. display blending mask (dual demosaic modes only) Show the blending mask that is used to differentiate between high and low frequency areas (adjusted by the \u0026ldquo;switch dual threshold\u0026rdquo; parameter). For each pixel, the brighter the mask, the more the module\u0026rsquo;s output is taken from the high frequency demosaic algorithm. capture sharpen Enable capture sharpening. Selecting this option will enable additional controls (see below) and attempt to auto-calculate the radius and contrast sensitivity based on the current image\u0026rsquo;s raw sensor data (see below). iterations (capture sharpen) The strength of the effect increases with more iterations. For most images a setting of 8 will be sufficient. radius (capture sharpen) Defines the mathematics used (sigma) for the special gaussian kernels. Analysis of many images (also from the RawTherapee community) show that, on modern sensors, using a good lens and a high quality demosaicer, a typical radius will be between 0.5 and 0.8. To auto-calculate the radius for the current image (based on raw sensor data), click the button on the right of the radius slider. The underlying algorithm has been used for some time with reliable results, though it might fail on images with lots of chroma noise. This calculation works better when the image is fully-zoomed out and uncropped in the darkroom view. Note: Do not manually increase the radius much further than the auto-calculated value, as this will soon lead to halo artifacts.\ncontrast sensitivity (capture sharpen) As sensor noise will typically be amplified by capture sharpening, we try to counter this problem by performing an analysis of local variance, luminance and a user-defined threshold. Sharpening is applied only to regions that are considered by this analysis to be safe. This analysis results in a mask that can be visualised by clicking the button to the right of the contrast sensitivity slider. For a good default we check the image ISO and sensor readout precision as a starting point. Very noisy images will require larger values than default. For very low sensor noise you can decrease the threshold to also improve capture sharpening in very dark parts of the image. corner boost / sharp center (capture sharpen) Most lenses are sharper in the central part than the corners of the image. Increasing the corner boost parameter causes a larger per-pixel radius to be used in the capture sharpen kernels for the image corners. This extra radius is controlled by the corner boost control. Adjusting the corner boost will cause an additional slider (sharp center) to appear. This controls the affected area using the distance from the image center. Again, the mask button to the right of the slider allows you to visualize the effect. 🔗presets, styles and copy/paste Defining demosaic presets or using demosaic parameters for styles or copying/pasting history stacks is a bit more tricky than for other modules. Please bear in mind that demosaic works for a range of sensors each offering different algorithms and some specific options. Here are some reminders:\nIt should always be safe to create an automatic preset that only applies to a specific camera. If a preset was defined while working on an image with a different sensor than the current image, darktable translates the algorithm as follows: bayer sensors fall back to RCD xtrans sensors fall back to markjestejn bayer4 sensors always use vng4. dual demosaicing will also be available on bayer and xtrans sensors Extra options like green equalizing will only be applied where they are supported by the current sensor. In auto-applied presets with capture sharpen enabled, you might want to use the auto-calculated radius (or contrast sensitivity) instead of using hard-coded values. To achieve this, you must set the radius (or contrast sensitivity) to zero before saving the preset. If this preset is then applied to another image, darktable accepts this as a request for these values to be automatically recalculated. Capture sharpening is not enabled by default but you could achieve this by defining an auto-applied preset after setting radius and contrast threshold to zero. You are advised to leave the iterations setting at its default setting of 8, as this leads to good sharpening with very low risk for artifacts when used with an auto-calculated radius.\nIt is generally safe to auto-apply capture sharpening to images with ISO values below 1000. If you have a good sensor, with low noise even on high ISO values, you might be able to use it for ISOs as high as 3200.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/demosaic/","tags":null,"title":"demosaic"},{"categories":null,"content":"An easy to use and highly efficient denoise module, adapted to the individual noise profiles of a wide range of camera sensors.\nOne issue with a lot of denoising algorithms is that they assume that the variance of the noise is independent of the luminosity of the signal. By profiling the noise characteristics of a camera\u0026rsquo;s sensor at different ISO settings, the variance at different luminosities can be assessed, and the denoising algorithm can be adjusted to more evenly smooth out the noise.\nCurrently, darktable has sensor noise profiles for over 300 popular camera models from all the major manufacturers. If you generate your own noise profile for a camera that is not yet supported by darktable, be sure to share it with the darktable development team so they can include it in the next release! Please see darktable\u0026rsquo;s camera support page for more information.\n🔗modes The denoise (profiled) module implements two algorithms, each of which is available in either an easy-to-use \u0026ldquo;auto\u0026rdquo; mode, or a more advanced manual mode with additional controls:\nnon-local means This algorithm works in the spatial domain in much the same way as the astrophoto denoise module. It averages each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the pixel being denoised. A patch with a defined size is used to measure that similarity. Note that this algorithm is quite resource-intensive.\nwavelets (default) This algorithm works in the wavelet domain, and provides a simplified user interface. Wavelet decomposition allows you to adjust the denoise strength depending on the coarseness of the noise in the image. This mode can be used in either Y0U0V0 color mode (which allows you to independently control luminance and chroma noise) or RGB color mode (which allows you to independently control noise for each RGB channel). The wavelet algorithm is less resource-intensive than non-local means.\n🔗luma versus chroma noise Both “non-local means” and “wavelet” algorithms can efficiently tackle luma (lightness) noise and chroma (color) noise.\nIn the past, it was suggested that you use two separate instances of this module to tackle chroma and luma noise independently (using chroma and lightness blending modes). This is no longer recommended, since the denoise (profiled) module is placed before the input color profile module in the pixelpipe (so that the profile parameters are accurate) and color blending modes should only be used after the input color profile has been applied.\nThe new algorithms in this module now provide their own methods to separately handle luma and chroma noise, and in both cases this can be handled with a single module instance.\n🔗module controls The denoise (profiled) module provides some controls that are independent of the algorithm used. These are described first, before moving on to the algorithm-specific controls.\nWhen describing the controls specific to an algorithm, we will first cover the simplified interface, and then move on to the more advanced controls for that algorithm.\nNote that sliders are provided with minimum and maximum values by default. However, these are only soft limits and, where needed, higher values can be entered by right-clicking on the slider and typing a new value.\n🔗common controls profile darktable automatically determines the camera model and ISO based on the Exif data of your raw file, and searches for a corresponding profile in its database. If your image has an intermediate ISO value, settings will be interpolated between the two closest datasets in the database, and this interpolated setting will show up as the first line in the combo box. You can also manually override this selection if necessary. Re-selecting the top-most entry in the combo box will return you to the default profile. mode Choose which denoising algorithm to use (see above), and whether to present the simplified (\u0026ldquo;auto\u0026rdquo;) or full manual interface for that algorithm. whitebalance-adaptive transform As the white balance amplifies each of the RGB channels differently, each channel exhibits different noise levels. This checkbox makes the selected algorithm adapt to the white balance adjustments. This option should be disabled on the second instance if you have applied a first instance with a color blend mode. adjust autoset parameters (auto modes only) Automatically adjust all the other parameters on the current denoising algorithm using a single slider. This is particularly useful when you have had to increase the exposure on an underexposed image, which normally introduces additional noise (as if you had taken the shot with a higher ISO). This control compensates for that by using settings similar to those used for a higher ISO image. The \u0026ldquo;effective ISO\u0026rdquo; used by the denoise algorithm is the actual ISO used, multiplied by the value of this slider. strength Fine-tune the strength of the denoising. The default value has been chosen to maximize the peak signal-to-noise ratio. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly a matter of taste \u0026ndash; whether you prefer a low noise level at the cost of fine details, or you accept more noise to better preserve fine detail. preserve shadows (advanced mode only) Lower this control to denoise the shadows more aggressively. Usually, as noise increases, you will need to decrease this parameter. bias correction (advanced mode only) Correct any color cast that may appear in the shadows. Increase this value if dark shadows appear too green, decrease if they appear too purple. 🔗non-local means auto sliders central pixel weight (details) Control the amount of detail that should be preserved by the denoising algorithm. By default, this will have a low value, meaning that the algorithm will treat both luma and chroma noise equally. Move this slider to the right to reduce the amount of luma denoising, so that the algorithm will primarily affect chroma noise. By adjusting this slider together with the strength slider, you can find a good balance between luma and chroma denoising. 🔗non-local means advanced sliders When you take non-local means out of auto mode, the adjust autoset parameters slider is replaced with the following controls. You can use the auto-adjust slider to arrive at some initial settings then, when you switch to manual mode, the sliders will show the equivalent manual settings. You can then continue to fine-tune the manual settings from the auto-set starting point.\npatch size Control the size of the patches being matched when deciding which pixels to average \u0026ndash; see astrophoto denoise for more information. Increase this for images with more noise but be aware that high values may smooth out fine edges. The effect of this slider on processing time is minimal. search radius Control how far away from a pixel the algorithm will attempt to find similar patches. Increasing the value can give better results for very noisy images when coarse grain noise is visible, but the processing time is hugely impacted by this parameter (the processing time increases with the square of this parameter). A lower value will make execution faster, a higher value will make it slower. It most cases it is better to use the scattering parameter, which has a similar effect but without the heavy processing cost. scattering (coarse-grain noise) Like the search radius, this slider controls how far from a pixel the algorithm will attempt to find similar patches. However, it does this without increasing the number of patches considered. As such, processing time will stay about the same. Increasing the value will reduce coarse grain noise, but may smooth local contrast. This slider is particularly effective at reducing chroma noise. 🔗wavelet curves Wavelet curves are shown when one of the “wavelet” modes is selected.\nThe noise in an image usually consists of both fine grain and coarse grain noise, to varying degrees. The wavelet curves allow the strength of the denoising to be adjusted depending on the coarseness of the visible noise. The left end of the curve will act on very coarse grain noise, while the right of the curve will act on very fine grain noise. Raising the curve will increase the amount of smoothing, while lowering the curve will decrease it.\nFor example, you can preserve very-fine-grain noise by pulling the right-most part of the curve down. When tackling chroma noise (e.g. on a U0V0 curve, or on a second module instance with a color blend mode) you can safely raise the right side of the curve, since colors do not change a lot on fine scales. This can be useful if you see some noisy isolated pixels with the wrong color.\n🔗wavelets Y0U0V0 color mode The preferred way to use wavelets is with the Y0U0V0 color mode. This mode separates the denoising curves into luminance (Y0) and color (U0V0) components. You can then use the Y0 curve to control the level of luma denoising, and the U0V0 curve to control the level of chroma denoising.\n🔗wavelets RGB color mode Before the Y0U0V0 color mode was introduced, wavelet-based denoising could only be performed directly on the R, G and B channels, either together or individually.\nIf you want to denoise the RGB channels independently, the best way to do this is to use an instance of the color calibration module placed immediately before the denoise (profiled) module so that it outputs a gray channel based on the red channel only, then denoise that monochrome image using the red wavelet curve. Repeat this procedure for the blue and green channels. This procedure is time-consuming, but gives the best result because looking at the color of a noisy pixel is not a reliable way to determine which channel to adjust. For example, a noisy red pixel could be due to a noise peak on the red channel, but could also be due to a noise lull on the blue and green channels.\nThe issue with independently denoising the RGB channels is that there can still be some residual chroma noise at the end that requires excessive smoothing to eliminate. This was in fact one of the key motivations behind implementing the Y0U0V0 color mode.\n🔗wavelets advanced sliders When you take wavelets out of auto mode, the adjust autoset parameters slider is replaced with the preserve shadows and bias correction controls listed above in the common controls section.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/denoise-profiled/","tags":null,"title":"denoise (profiled)"},{"categories":null,"content":"Photography has a long history of producing monochrome images, and many still enjoy this aspect of photography. While there are some specialized/modified cameras with a truly monochrome sensor, most still use a regular camera to capture a color image and transform it into a monochrome image during post-processing.\nThere are two main approaches to this conversion:\nA physical approach, where we attempt to simulate how a silver-based photographic film emulsion would react to the light captured at the scene.\nA perceptual approach, where we develop a color image and reduce the color saturation in a perceptual color space such as CIE Lab.\nThese approaches, and other monochrome-related features in darktable, are discussed in the following sections.\n🔗importing and flagging images as monochrome When importing an image, there are a number of properties that can be used to indicate that the image requires a monochrome treatment:\nIf the image was taken using an achromatic camera, the image will be automatically flagged as monochrome.\nWhen you capture a scene from which you would like to produce a monochrome image, it can be helpful to put your camera into a \u0026ldquo;black \u0026amp; white\u0026rdquo; creative mode. This allows you to visualise what the scene would look like in monochrome through your camera\u0026rsquo;s liveview screen or electronic viewfinder. The camera will still capture the full color data in the raw file, but the embedded JPEG preview image will be monochrome. When you import such an image, darktable can automatically flag the image as monochrome based on the preview image.\nChecking whether the preview is monochrome slows down the import process, so this is disabled by default. You can enable this check in preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; detect monochrome previews\nWhen processing a raw file, one of the first steps is to demosaic the image. If you set the demosaicing method to \u0026ldquo;passthrough (monochrome)\u0026rdquo;, this discards color information during the demosaicing process, and darktable will flag the image as monochrome.\nNote: You should only use this for images taken on a camera where the color filter array has been removed.\nAfter you have imported the image, you can manually flag an image as monochrome (or not) using the metadata tab on the lighttable\u0026rsquo;s actions on selection module,\nIf any of the above methods result in an image being flagged as monochrome, darktable modules can use this information to present the user with some monochrome-specific module controls and/or apply special processing to the image.\nThe darktable|mode|monochrome tag will be automatically applied to any images flagged as monochrome and, if you have enabled any permanent overlay information on your lighttable thumbnails, such images will be marked with a visual indicator B\u0026amp;W next to the file type information. By automatically applying this tag and visual indicator, darktable makes it easy to set up filters to single out images for monochrome treatment, and to see at a glance which images in the current collection bear the monochrome tag.\nIf darktable detects a true monochrome image or one from a monochrome-converted camera (using the \u0026ldquo;passthrough monochrome\u0026rdquo; demosaicer) some modules (e.g. demosaic, white balance) are automatically disabled.\n🔗monochrome conversion 🔗physical approach This approach tends to work with linear scene-referred data from the sensor, and attempts to mimic the response of a photographic film with a silver emulsion. It consists of three steps:\nMap the color channels from the sensor into a single monochrome channel. Different types of monochrome photographic film have different levels of sensitivity to various wavelengths of light, and this can be simulated by giving the three color channels different weightings when combining them together into a single monochrome channel. The color calibration module allows the three channels to be mixed into a gray channel by varying amounts, and it includes a number of presets that are designed to emulate the characteristics of some well-known types of photographic film.\nApply a luminosity saturation curve. As a piece of photographic film is exposed to more intense light, its response will fall off as the silver emulsion becomes saturated. This saturation curve can be simulated within the filmic rgb module.\nDeveloping a monochrome film in the darkroom traditionally involves \u0026ldquo;dodging and burning\u0026rdquo; to control the level of exposure across different parts of the image. This can be emulated in darktable by using either the exposure module with manually created masks, or by using the tone equalizer module, which generates a mask using a guided filter.\n🔗perceptual approach The other option for producing a monochrome image is to reduce the color saturation in the image, which can be done in a linear colorspace, or in a color space oriented towards modelling human perception.\nThe color balance module operates in linear RGB, and allows you to reduce the color saturation in the image using either the input or output color saturation slider \u0026ndash; which you choose depends on whether you want to make any other adjustments to either the color or monochrome image in the color balance module. The color balance module tends to give a predictable and perceptually-uniform result.\nThe monochrome module works in Lab color space, and it allows the user to graphically define a weighted combination of colors to determine the density of the blacks in the monochrome image. The interface can be somewhat sensitive to the settings, with small changes producing large effects, and you may experience problems with the global contrast and/or black pixel artifacts.\nOther modules such as color zones can also be used to remove color saturation from the image, but these don\u0026rsquo;t offer any real advantage over the simplicity of the color balance module\u0026rsquo;s saturation sliders.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/guides-tutorials/monochrome/","tags":null,"title":"developing monochrome images"},{"categories":null,"content":"Diffusion is a family of physical processes by which particles move and spread gradually with time, from a source that generates them. In image processing, diffusion mostly occurs in two places:\ndiffusion of photons through lens glass (blur) or humid air (hazing), diffusion of pigments in wet inks or watercolors. In both cases, diffusion makes the image less sharp by \u0026ldquo;leaking\u0026rdquo; particles and smoothing local variations.\nThe diffuse or sharpen module uses a generalized physical model to describe several kinds of diffusion, and can be used by image makers to either simulate or revert diffusion processes.\nAs it is a highly technical module, several presets are provided to demonstrate its use for various purposes.\nDiffusion can be removed in order to:\nrecover the original image from sensors with an anti-aliasing filter or mitigate the blur created by most demosaicing algorithms (use one of the sharpen demosaicing presets and move the module before the input color profile module in the pipeline), reverse static lens blurring/defocusing (use one of the lens deblur presets), remove atmospheric haze (use the dehaze preset), add extra acutance for better legibility (use the local contrast preset). Note that motion blurs cannot be reverted by undoing the diffusion process, as they are not diffusive in nature.\nDiffusion can be added in order to:\ncreate a bloom or Orton effect (use the bloom preset), inpaint missing or damaged parts of an image (use the inpaint highlights preset), denoise in an edge-preserving way (use one of the denoise presets) apply a surface blur (use the surface blur preset). Since the process is physical, even its glitches may be used for creative purposes. For example, you can:\nsimulate line drawing or watercolor (use the simulate line drawing and simulate watercolor presets), create random patterns and textures by increasing noise (over time, with iterations, noise will connect with neighbors to create random specks). Note: This module is highly resource-intensive, as it is actually an anisotropic, multiscale, partial differential equation solver. The module\u0026rsquo;s runtime increases with the number of iterations and OpenCL is therefore strongly recommended. Some \u0026ldquo;fast\u0026rdquo; presets are also provided for use on systems without OpenCL.\n🔗concepts 🔗time Diffusion is a time-dependent process: the more time it has, the further the particles can spread. In this module, time is simulated using the number of iterations (the number of times the algorithm runs on top of itself). More iterations can make reconstruction (deblurring, denoising, dehazing) more accurate if properly set, but can also cause it to degenerate.\n🔗direction Natural diffusion usually takes place from points with a high potential (high energy or high concentration of particles) to those with a low potential (low energy or low concentration of particles). In an image, this means that diffusion always occurs from the brightest pixels to the darkest.\nThis particular implementation can simulate natural diffusion, using what is called an isotropic diffusion (all directions have the same weight, like heat diffusion), but can also force a weighted direction parallel to the gradients (forcing diffusion across object edges and creating ghost edges), or a weighted direction perpendicular to the gradients, called isophote (forcing diffusion to be contained inside edges, like in a droplet of watercolor). The relative weight of each direction (gradient and isophote) is user-defined and can be found in the direction section of the module.\n🔗speed Depending how fluid the environment is, particles can move more or less freely and therefore more or less fast. The speed of diffusion can be set in the speed section of the module.\nWhen performing reconstruction (denoising, deblurring, dehazing), it is advisable to use smaller speeds for better accuracy. This prevents numerical overshoots (and therefore degeneration of the solution) and may require more iterations. For small numbers of iterations, higher speeds may be used. Note that large blurs need many iterations for proper reconstruction, so the speed should be adjusted to avoid degenerating the solution.\nAll speeds are added (first to fourth orders), and the sums \u0026ldquo;first order + second order\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;third order + fourth order\u0026rdquo; should never exceed ±100%, unless you want to produce glitch art.\n🔗scale Natural diffusion is supposed to happen only to the closest neighboring coordinates. That is, at each iteration, each pixel should only interact with its 9 nearest neighbors.\nHere, we fast-track things a bit to save time and reuse the multi-scale wavelets scheme from the contrast equalizer module, so that we can diffuse at different scales. The maximal scale of diffusion is defined by the radius span parameter.\nRegardless of the diffusion, a sharpness parameter allows you to increase or decrease the details at each scale, much like the spline controls of the contrast equalizer. Along with the edge sensitivity slider, this provides the same features as the contrast equalizer module (luma and edges tabs) but in a scene-referred RGB space.\n🔗module controls 🔗properties iterations The number of times the algorithm should run on top of itself. High values slow the module down but allow more accurate reconstructions, provided that the diffusion speeds are low enough. central radius The main scale of the diffusion. Zero causes the diffusion to act more heavily on fine details (used for deblurring and denoising). Non-zero values define the size of details to be heavily diffused (used to increase local contrast). radius span This allows you to select the band of details radii to act on, around the central radius. The span of diffusion defines a range of detail scales (between center - span and center + span) within which the diffusion is confined. High values diffuse on a large band of radii, at the expense of computation time. Low values diffuse closer around the central radius. If you plan to deblur, the radius span should be approximately the width of your lens blur and the central radius should be zero. If you plan to increase the local contrast, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to affect sharpness or noise, the radius span should be 3/4 of your central radius maximum. The radii are expressed in pixels of the full-resolution image, so copy+pasting settings between images of different resolution may lead to slightly different results, except for pixel-level sharpness.\nFor electrical engineers, what is set here is a band-pass filter in wavelets space, using a gaussian frequential window centered on central radius with a fall-off (standard deviation) of radius span. Wavelet scales are analogous to harmonic frequencies and each wavelet scale defines the radius of the details to act on.\n🔗speed (sharpen ↔ diffuse) In the following controls, positive values apply diffusion, negative values undo diffusion (i.e. sharpen) and zero does nothing.\n1st order speed (gradient) The speed of diffusion of the low-frequency wavelet layers in the direction defined by the 1st order anisotropy setting. 2nd order speed (laplacian) The speed of diffusion of the low-frequency wavelet layers in the direction defined by the 2nd order anisotropy setting. 3rd order speed (gradient of laplacian) The speed of diffusion of the high-frequency wavelet layers in the direction defined by the 3rd order anisotropy setting. 4th order speed (laplacian of laplacian) The speed of diffusion of the high-frequency wavelet layers in the direction defined by the 4th order anisotropy setting. 🔗direction In the following controls, positive values cause diffusion to avoid edges (isophotes), negative values make diffusion follow gradients more closely, and zero affects both equally (isotropic).\n1st order anisotropy The direction of diffusion of the low-frequency wavelet layers relative to the orientation of the gradient of the low-frequency (1st order speed setting). 2nd order anisotropy The direction of diffusion of the low-frequency wavelet layers relative to the orientation of the gradient of the high-frequency (2nd order speed setting). 3rd order anisotropy The direction of diffusion of the high-frequency wavelet layers relative to the orientation of the gradient of the low-frequency (3rd order speed setting). 4th order anisotropy The direction of diffusion of the high-frequency wavelet layers relative to the orientation of the gradient of the high-frequency (4th order speed setting). 🔗edge management sharpness Apply a gain on wavelet details, regardless of properties set above. Zero does nothing, positive values sharpen, negative values blur. This is mostly useful as an adjustment variable when blooming or blurring, to retain some sharpness while adding a glow around edges. You are not advised to use this for sharpening alone, since there is nothing to prevent halos or fringes with this setting. edge sensitivity Apply a penalty over the diffusion speeds when edges are detected. This detection uses the local variance around each pixel. Zero disables the penalty, higher values make the penalty stronger and more sensitive to edges. Increase if you notice edge artifacts like fringes and halos. edge threshold Define a variance threshold, which affects mostly low-variance areas (dark or blurry areas, or flat surfaces). Positive values will increase the penalty for low-variance areas, which is good for sharpening or increasing local contrast without crushing blacks. Negative values will decrease the penalty for low-variance areas, which is good for denoising or blurring with a maximal effect on black and blurry regions. 🔗diffusion spatiality luminance masking threshold This control is useful if you want to in-paint highlights. For values greater than 0%, the diffusion will only occur in regions with a luminance greater than this setting. Note that gaussian noise will be added in these regions to simulate particles and initialize the in-painting. 🔗workflow The main difficulty with this module is that while its output can vary dramatically depending on its input parameters, these parameters have no intuitive link to everyday life. Users are likely to be overwhelmed, unless they are already familiar with Fourier partial differential equations. This section proposes some ways to approach this module without the burden of having to understand the underlying theory.\n🔗general advice If you intend to deblur your image using this module, always start by properly correcting any chromatic aberrations and noise in the image, since the deblurring may magnify these artifacts. It is also important that you don\u0026rsquo;t have clipped black pixels in your image. These can be corrected with the black level correction of the exposure module.\nSince it works on separate RGB channels, it is better to apply this module after color calibration, so that you start with a fully neutral, white-balanced, input image. Note that increasing local contrast or sharpness will also lead to a slight color contrast and saturation boost, which is usually a good thing. Since it uses a variance-based regularization to detect edges, it is also better to put this module before any non-linear operation.\n🔗starting with presets The provided presets have been tuned by the developer and tested on a range of images for typical purposes. The easiest way is simply to start from the presets, and then tweak them as needed:\nif the effect seems too strong, decrease the number of iterations, if edge artifacts appear, increase the edge sensitivity, if deblurring starts to affect valid blurry parts (bokeh), reduce the radius, if deblurring seems correct in bright areas but excessive in dark areas, increase the edges threshold, if deblurring clips black pixels, lower the black level correction in exposure module, fine-tune the sharpness to your taste. 🔗starting from scratch The module\u0026rsquo;s default settings are entirely neutral and will do nothing to your image. The spirit of the module is that each order affects the texture of the image in a particular way.\nStart by tuning the first order parameters (speed and anisotropy) to get an initial base. Then adjust the radius. This will affect coarser textures (either blur or sharpen them). Remember that the first order acts on the low frequencies of the wavelet scale and follows a direction parallel or perpendicular to the gradient of the low frequencies.\nNext, start to tune the second order parameters (speed and anisotropy). The second order also acts on the low frequencies of the wavelet scale but this time follows a direction parallel or perpendicular to the gradient of the high frequencies, which can either be the direction of maximal sharpness or of noise. This can be used to reduce noise (using the second order in diffusion mode, with positive values) when you used the first order in sharpening mode (with negative values).\nThese two steps can be performed on the zoomed-out image. Remember that, while great care has been taken to make the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s visual result fairly scale-invariant, the preview will be exact only when zoomed 1:1. In any case, anything happening at pixel level (radius \u0026lt; 2px) will not be visible for zoom levels lower than 50%.\nAt this point, you may want to tweak the edge sensitivity to take care of any edge artifacts. In theory, diffusing in the isophote direction ensures that diffusion is contained inside edges, but this is not sufficient when corners and sharp convex shapes are present in the image.\nWhen the edge sensitivity control has been adjusted to produce satisfying results, the image usually becomes quite soft. In most cases it will be necessary, at this point, to increase the number of iterations in order to compensate. This will come with a performance penalty so tread carefully with the performance/quality trade-off depending on your hardware. If you can\u0026rsquo;t increase the number of iterations, you will have to increase the diffusing speed.\nThe final step is to fine-tune the third and fourth order, which take care of the high frequencies of each wavelet scale. You will need to be a lot more gentle with these settings than for the first and second orders, as they can cause noise to blow-up really fast.\nThe third order follows the gradient or isophote direction of the low frequency layer, so can be used to guide the high frequency diffusion in a direction that is more likely to be legitimate regarding real edges (and less prone to catch noise).\nThe fourth order follows the gradient or isophote direction of the high frequency layer and is more likely to catch noise. Diffusing on the fourth order is the best way to reduce noise without affecting sharpness too much, either as a stand-alone denoiser, or as a regularization step in a deblurring process.\n🔗using multiple instances for image reconstruction Noise post-filtering may benefit from introducing a diffusion process \u0026ndash; this can be applied as an extra step after the denoise (profiled) module.\nConversely, the following optical issues may benefit from reconstruction by undoing the diffusion process:\nblur introduced by a sensor\u0026rsquo;s low-pass filter (LPF) and/or anti-aliasing performed by the demosaic module, static lens blur, haze/fog, light diffusion (using a diffuser that is too large), leading to even lighting and lack of local contrast on the subject. While more than one of these issues can affect the same image at the same time, it is better to try to fix them separately using multiple instances of the module. When doing so, ensure the issues are corrected from coarse scale to fine scale, and that denoising always happens first. That is, your instances should appear in the following pipe order:\ndenoise, local contrast enhancement, dehaze, lens blur correction, sensor and demosaic correction. Starting with the coarser-scale reconstructions reduces the probability of introducing or increasing noise when performing the finer-scale reconstructions. This is unintuitive because these processes don\u0026rsquo;t happen in this order during the formation of the image. For the same reason, denoising should always happen before any attempt at sharpening or increasing acutance.\n🔗notes and warnings While this module is designed to be scale-invariant, its output can only be guaranteed at 100% zoom and high quality or full-size export. Results at lower zoom levels or export dimensions may or may not match your expectations.\nWhen setting a deblurring algorithm, try to bear in mind that many of the greatest images in the history of photography were taken with lenses that were not remotely as sharp as those available today. Although the current trend is to build and sell increasingly sharp lenses and have software apply insane amounts of sharpening on top, this fashion does not lead to better imagery and makes the retouching process more tedious. Soft focus and a bit of blurriness have some poetic merits too, which surgically-sanitized HD images may fail to convey.\nIt should be noted that global contrast (using simple tone curves or black/white levels) also affects our perception of sharpness, which is quite different from optical sharpness (optical resolution). Human eyes are only sensitive to local contrast, which may come from optical sharpness (e.g absence of diffusion \u0026ndash; thin edges) as well as from amplified tonal transitions. If some global tone mapping is in place to increase the contrast, the image will look sharper. If a tone mapping is used to decrease the contrast, the image will look more blurry. In none of these cases are the actual edges of objects affected in any way, and the perceptual consequences are pure illusion.\nPart of the aging process is a loss of eyesight. The amount of sharpening that people over 50 find pleasing may not be the same as for people in their 20s. It is worth considering sharpening to obtain a plausible result (matching your everyday perception) rather than a pleasing result (that may look good only to people with the same eyesight as yours).\nFinally, assessing the sharpness of images zoomed to 1:1 (100%) or more is a foolish task. In museums, exhibitions and even on screen, the general audience looks at images as a whole, not with a magnifying glass. Moreover, in most practical uses, photographs rarely exceed a resolution of 3000×2000 pixels (roughly a 300 DPI print at A4/Letter dimensions) which, for 24 megapixel sensors, means downscaling by a factor of 4. When examining a 24 megapixel file at 1:1, you are actually looking at an image that will never exist. Sharpening at pixel level, in this context, is a waste of time and CPU cycles.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/diffuse/","tags":null,"title":"diffuse or sharpen"},{"categories":null,"content":"This module eliminates some of the banding artifacts that can result when darktable\u0026rsquo;s internal 32-bit floating point data is transferred into discrete 8-bit or 16-bit integer output format for display or export. It can also be used for creative posterization effects.\nAlthough not an inherent problem in any of darktable\u0026rsquo;s modules, some operations may provoke banding if they produce a lightness gradient in the image. To mitigate possible artifacts you should consider activating dithering when using the vignetting or graduated density modules. This is especially relevant for images with extended homogeneous areas such as cloudless sky. Also watch out for banding artifacts when using a gradient drawn mask.\nViewing an image dithered into a very low bit depth from some distance (e.g. “Floyd-Steinberg 1-bit b\u0026amp;w”) will give the impression of a homogeneous grayscale image. darktable attempts to mimic this impression when rendering zoomed-out images in the center view, the navigation window and thumbnails. This is accomplished by dithering those images into a higher number of grayscale levels. Note that, as a consequence, the scopes module \u0026ndash; the data for which is derived from the navigation window \u0026ndash; will show this increased number of levels and is therefore not a full match to the output image.\n🔗module controls method Choose the dithering method to use. Floyd-Steinberg (default): Systematically distribute quantization errors over neighboring pixels. This method can be selected with some typical output bit depths. Alternatively, you can select Floyd-Steinberg auto, which automatically adapts to the desired output format.\nrandom dithering: This method just adds some level of randomness to break sharp tonal value bands.\nposterization: This method quantizes the pixel values into the indicated number of distinct levels per color channel (similar to Floyd-Steinberg) but does not redistribute the quantization errors, producing a posterization effect. Selecting two levels per channel produces eight possible output colors, three levels produces 27 colors (3x3x3), and so on. Use other modules affecting colors or tone curves (such as tone equalizer or color balance rgb) to fine-tune which pixels produce which posterized colors. You can also use various blending modes to control the colors of the result.\ndamping (\u0026ldquo;random\u0026rdquo; method only) Controls the level of added random noise expressed as a damping factor in a 10*log 2 basis. A value of -80 is a good fit for 8-bit output formats as it corresponds to a maximum change of one of the 256 possible levels; -160 is a good fit for for 16-bit output.

Darktable automatically selects the exposure compensation that is required to shift the selected percentile to the selected target level (see definitions below). This mode is particularly useful for automatically altering a large number of images to have the same exposure. A typical use case of automatic mode is deflickering of time-lapse photographs. 🔗module controls mode Choose the mode of operation (automatic/manual). compensate camera exposure (manual mode) Automatically remove the camera exposure bias (taken from the image\u0026rsquo;s Exif data). exposure (manual mode) Increase (move to the right) or decrease (move to the left) the exposure value (EV). To adjust by more than the default limits shown on the slider, right click and enter the desired value up to +/-18 EV (see module controls). The picker tool on the right sets the exposure such that the average of the selected region matches the target lightness defined in area exposure mapping options. percentile (automatic mode) Define a location in the histogram to use for automatic exposure correction. A percentile of 50% denotes a position in the histogram where 50% of pixel values are above and 50% of pixel values are below that exposure. target level (automatic mode) Define the target level for automatic exposure correction (EV) relative to the white point of the camera. black level correction (manual and automatic modes) Adjust the black level point to unclip negative RGB values. Note: Do not use the black level correction to add more density in blacks as this can clip near-black colors out of gamut by generating negative RGB values. This can cause problems with some modules later in the pixelpipe. Instead, use a tone mapping curve to add density to the blacks. For example, you can use the relative black exposure slider on the scene tab of the filmic rgb module, or establish a deeper toe in the base curve module.\n🔗area exposure mapping The area mapping feature is designed to help with batch-editing a series of images in an efficient way. In this scenario, you typically develop a single reference image for the whole batch and then copy\u0026amp;paste the development stack to all of the other images in the batch.\nUnfortunately, the light often changes slightly between shots, even within the same series captured in the same conditions. This can be the result of a cloud passing by the sun in natural light, surface reflections having less \u0026ldquo;shine\u0026rdquo; from a different angle, or simply due to unavoidable variability in the mechanical diaphragm aperture. Each image will still need some individual fine-tuning if you want a perfectly even look over the whole series, and this can be both time-consuming and frustrating.\nArea exposure mapping allows you to define a target brightness, in terms of exposure, for a particular region of the image (the control sample), which you then match against the same target brightness in other images. The control sample can either be a critical part of your subject that needs to have constant brightness, or a non-moving and consistently-lit surface over your series of images.\nThe mapping process consists of two steps.\n🔗step 1: set the target There are two ways of setting the target brightness for your control sample:\nif you know or expect an arbitrary lightness for the control sample (for example, a gray card, a color chart, a product or a logo of a specified brightness), you can set its L value directly, in CIE Lab 1976 space, if you simply want to match the development of your reference image, set the area mode to measure, then enable the picker (to the right of the exposure slider) and draw a rectangle over your control sample. The input column will then be updated with the lightness value of the control sample before the exposure correction, and the target column will show the resulting lightness of the control sample after the current exposure setting is applied. If you reset the lightness value, the default value is 50% (middle-gray) \u0026ndash; this can be useful to quickly set the average exposure of any image.\nNote that the target value is not reset when you reset the module itself, but is stored indefinitely in darktable\u0026rsquo;s configuration and will be available on next launch as well as for the next image you develop.\n🔗step 2 : match the target When you open a new image, the area mode is automatically reset to correction. Using the picker attached to the exposure slider, you can then directly reselect your control sample in the new image. The proper exposure setting required for the control sample to match the memorized target lightness will be automatically computed, and the setting will be updated in the same operation.\nThis operation can be repeated as many times as you have images in your series with no further work.\nNote 1: Trying to match lightness of moving parts of a subject across frames can prove tricky because they can have legitimate changes in their illumination as their orientation changes with respect to the main light source. For example, a part of the face can be fully lit in some frames and partially shaded in others. An inconsistently-lit control sample will generally not provide a robust reference for lightness matching across a series and may result in more work than manually matching it with visual feedback.\nNote 2: The exposure module works (by default) in the scene-referred, linear, camera RGB part of the pixel pipeline, before the input color profile is applied. However, the conversion from camera RGB to CIE Lab 1976 space relies on the input color profile. All of the lightness L metrics given in the area mapping settings will use the input profile defined later in the input color profile module to perform the conversion accurately, but the conversion itself assumes a linear (RAW) signal and will not work for JPEG and PNG images (which are non-linearly encoded before the input color profile module). If you want to use this feature on non-RAW images, you will need to move the exposure module to after input color profile or to use the module order preset v3.0 for JPEG/non-RAW input.\nNote 3: Perfectly matching your control sample against the target lightness may still not yield a similar perceptual result, even if the numbers are exactly the same. For example, if your subject sits in front of a background made of some bright parts and some dark parts, the ratio of bright areas / dark areas will affect the perception of contrast and brightness. If this ratio changes across your series, the subject brightness will not appear constant even though the lightness value is exactly constant. For more details, see the checker shadow illusion and the Chubb illusion.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/exposure/","tags":null,"title":"exposure"},{"categories":null,"content":"Generate a raster mask from a .pfm to be used by subsequent processing modules.\nNote: .pfm files are not very common but darktable and GIMP can both generate such files.

Highlights will need extra care when details need to be preserved (e.g. clouds).\nThe module is derived from another module of the same name in Blender 3D modeller by T. J. Sobotka. While it is primarily intended to recover high-dynamic-range images from raw sensor data it can be used with any image in place of the base curve module.\nYou can automatically enable this module in new images by setting the value of preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults to \u0026lsquo;scene-referred (filmic)\u0026rsquo;.\nNote: Despite the technical look of this module, the best way to set it up is to assess the quality of the visual result. Do not overthink the numbers that are presented in the GUI to quantify the strength of the effects.\n🔗prerequisites In order to get the best from this module, your images need some preparation:\ncapturing (ETTR) In-camera, it is recommended that you use a technique known as \u0026ldquo;Expose To The Right\u0026rdquo; (ETTR). This means exposing the shot so that the exposure is as bright as possible without clipping the highlights. It is called \u0026ldquo;exposing to the right\u0026rdquo; because the in-camera histogram should be touching all the way up to the right hand side without peaking at the right hand side (which could indicate clipping). This technique ensures you make maximum use of the dynamic range of your camera\u0026rsquo;s sensor. The default auto-exposure metering mode in your camera will normally expose the image so that the average brightness in the image tends towards middle-gray. Sometimes, for scenes dominated by light tones, the camera will underexpose the image to bring those light tones more towards middle-gray. For scenes dominated by dark tones, it may overexpose the image and end up clipping the highlights. In such cases you can use the exposure compensation dial in your camera to raise or lower the exposure \u0026ndash; the darktable exposure module can automatically take this into account when processing your image.\nIn some cases (e.g. specular highlights reflecting off shiny objects) it may be acceptable to have some clipping, but be aware that any clipped data in your image is irrevocably lost. Where data has been clipped, filmic rgb offers a \u0026ldquo;highlight reconstruction\u0026rdquo; feature to help mitigate the effects of the clipping and blend it smoothly with the rest of the image. The settings for this feature are on the reconstruct tab. Some cameras also offer a \u0026ldquo;highlight priority\u0026rdquo; exposure metering mode that can help to maximise exposure while protecting the highlights, and many offer features such as \u0026ldquo;zebras\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;blinkies\u0026rdquo; in the live view to alert the photographer when parts of the image are being clipped.\nadjust for the mid-tones In the exposure module, adjust the exposure until the mid-tones are clear enough. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about losing the highlights at this point \u0026ndash; they will be recovered as part of the filmic processing. However, it is important to avoid negative pixels in black areas else the computations performed by filmic rgb may produce unpredictable results. For some camera models (Canon, mainly), rawspeed (the raw decoding library of darktable) may set an exaggerated black level, resulting in crushed blacks and negative pixel values. If so, brighten the blacks by setting a negative black level correction value in the exposure module. white balance, denoise, demosaic If you plan on using filmic rgb\u0026rsquo;s auto-tuners, use the white balance module to first correct any color casts and obtain neutral colors. In RGB color spaces, luminance and chrominance are linked, and filmic rgb\u0026rsquo;s luminance detection relies on accurate measurements of both. If your image is very noisy, add an initial step of denoising to improve the black exposure readings, and use a high quality demosaic algorithm. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about noise if you are planning to set up filmic manually, without using the auto-tuners. disable tone mapping modules If you plan to use one of filmic rgb\u0026rsquo;s chrominance preservation modes, avoid using base curve and the various tone mapping modules. These may produce unpredictable color shifts that would make the chrominance preservation useless. None of these modules should be required when using filmic rgb. 🔗usage The filmic rgb module is designed to map the dynamic range of the photographed scene (RAW image) to the dynamic range of the display.\nThis mapping is defined in three steps, each handled in a separate tab in the interface:\nThe scene tab contains the “input” settings of the scene, defining what constitutes white and black in the photographed scene.\nThe reconstruct tab offers tools to handle blown highlights.\nThe look tab contains the artistic intent of the mapping that is applied to the input parameters (as defined in the scene tab). This part of the module applies an S-shaped parametric curve to enhance the contrast of the mid-tones and remap the gray value to the middle-gray of the display. This is similar to what the base curve and tone curve modules do.\nThe display tab defines the output settings required to map the transformed image to the display. In typical use cases, the parameters in this tab rarely require adjustment.\nThe options tab includes some optional advanced settings and parameters.\nfilmic rgb tends to compress local contrast, so after you have finished adjusting settings here, you may wish to compensate for this using the local contrast module. You may also want to increase the saturation in the color balance rgb module, and perhaps to further adjust the tones using the tone equalizer.\nThe ranges of filmic rgb\u0026rsquo;s sliders are limited to typical and safe values, but you can enter values outside of these limits by right-clicking and entering values with the keyboard.\nNote: filmic rgb cannot be set with entirely neutral parameters (resulting in a \u0026ldquo;no-operation\u0026rdquo;) \u0026ndash; as soon as the module is enabled, the image is always at least slightly affected. You can, however, come close to neutral with the following settings:\nin the look tab, set contrast to 1.0, latitude to 99 % and mid-tones saturation to 0 %, in the options tab, set contrast in shadows and in highlights to soft. In this configuration, filmic will only perform a logarithmic tone mapping between the bounds set in the scene tab.\n🔗graphic display The graphic display at the top of the filmic rgb module offers multiple views to help you to understand its functionality. You can cycle through these views using the icon to the right of the graph display. You can also toggle the labels on the axes on and off using the icon.\nThe following views are available:\nlook only This is the default view. The main bright curve shows how the dynamic range of the scene (in EV) is compressed into the display-referred output range. The orange dot shows the middle-gray point, the white dots either side mark out the latitude range, and the orange part of the curve at the bottom and top indicates an overshoot problem with the spline (the look tab has some controls to deal with this). look + mapping (linear) This view shows the mapping of input values [0,1] to output values in linear space, including the dynamic range mapping and the output transfer function. Note that in a scene-referred workflow, input values are allowed to exceed 1, however the graph only shows in/out values in the interval [0,1] in order to make the shape of the graph comparable to other tone curve mapping tools such as base curve or tone curve. The actual value of the scene white point is shown in brackets on the X axis (expressed as a percentage of an input value of 1). look + mapping (log) The same as the previous view, but plotted in log space. dynamic range mapping This view is inspired by the Ansel Adams Zone System, showing how the zones in the input scene (EV) are mapped to the output. Middle gray from the scene is always mapped to 18% in the output (linear) space, and the view shows how the tonal ranges towards the extremes of the scene exposure range are compressed into a smaller number of zones in the display space, leaving more room for the mid-tones to be spread out over the remaining zones. The latitude range is represented by the darker gray portion in the middle. Note: When some parameters are too extreme, resulting in an unfeasible curve, filmic rgb will sanitize them internally. Sanitizing is illustrated in two ways on the look views:\nA dot becoming red indicates that the linear part of the curve is pushed too far towards the top or the bottom. In the look tab, reduce the latitude or recenter the linear part using the shadows ↔ highlights balance parameter. A dot becoming a half circle indicates that contrast is too low given the dynamic range of the image. Increase contrast in the look tab, or the dynamic range in the scene tab. 🔗module controls 🔗scene The controls in the scene tab are similar in principle to those of the levels module (black, gray, white). The difference is that levels assumes display-referred pixels values (between 0 and 100%), whereas filmic allows you to work on scene-referred pixels (between \u0026ndash;infinity EV and +infinity EV), which forces the use of a different interface.\nmiddle-gray luminance (hidden by default) This setting allows you to decide what luminance in the scene should be considered the reference middle-gray (which will be remapped to 18% in display). Use the picker tool to read the average luminance over the drawn area. If you have a photograph of a gray card or a color chart (IT8 chart or colorchecker) shot in the scene lighting conditions, then the gray picker tool can be used to quickly sample the luminance of the gray patch on that image. In other situations, the picker can be used to sample the average luminance of the subject. This has an effect on the image that is analogous to a brightness correction. Values close to 100% do not compress the highlights but fail to recover shadows. Values close to 0% greatly recover the shadows but compress the highlights more harshly and result in local-contrast losses.\nWhen modifying the middle-gray luminance, the white and black exposures are automatically adjusted accordingly, to prevent the dynamic range from clipping and to help you set the right parameter faster. If you are not happy with the auto adjustment performed by the gray slider, you can correct the white and black exposure parameters afterwards.\nNote: You are not advised to use this control to set middle-gray, hence it is now hidden by default. You should instead use the exposure module to set the middle-gray level (see usage, above). However, if you wish to make this slider visible, you can enable it with the use custom middle-gray values checkbox in the options tab.\nwhite relative exposure The number of stops (EV) between the scene middle-gray luminance and the scene luminance to be remapped to display white (peak-white). This is the right bound of the scene dynamic range that will be represented on the display \u0026ndash; everything brighter than this value on the scene will be clipped (pure white) on the display. The picker tool reads the maximum luminance in RGB space over the drawn area, assumes it is pure white, and sets the white exposure parameter to remap the maximum to 100% luminance. black relative exposure The number of stops (EV) between the scene middle-gray luminance and the scene luminance to be remapped to display black (maximum density). This is the left bound of the scene dynamic range that will be represented on the display \u0026ndash; everything darker than this value on the scene will be clipped (pure black) on the display. The picker tool reads the minimum luminance in RGB space over the drawn area, assumes it is pure black, and sets the black exposure parameter to remap the minimum to 0% luminance. The black picker measurement is very sensitive to noise, and cannot identify whether the minimum luminance is pure black (actual data) or just noise. It works better on low ISO images and with high quality demosaicing. When the picker puts the black exposure at \u0026ndash;16 EV, this is a sign that the measurement has failed and you will need to adjust it manually. The black relative exposure allows you to choose how far you want to recover lowlights.\ndynamic range scaling and auto-tune The auto-tune picker combines the above pickers, and allows you to set the white and black exposures at the same time, using the maximum of the drawn region as the white and the minimum as the black. This gives good results in landscape photography but usually fails for portraits and indoor scenes. When no true white and black are available on the scene, the maximum and minimum RGB values read on the image are not valid assumptions any more. Dynamic range scaling symmetrically shrinks or enlarges the detected dynamic range and the current parameters. This works with both pickers, and adjusts the current values of white and black relative exposures.\nNote: There is no direct relationship between your camera sensor\u0026rsquo;s dynamic range (to be found in DxoMark.com or PhotonsToPhotos.org measurements) and the dynamic range in filmic (scene white EV \u0026ndash; scene black EV). Many things happen before filmic in the pipeline (for example a black raw offset that could map black to 0) such that filmic sees a theoretically infinite dynamic range at its input. This has to do only with pixel encoding manipulation in software, not actual sensor capabilities.\nThe scene-referred workflow forces a black level correction of \u0026ndash;0.0002, in the exposure module, which ensures that the dynamic range seen by filmic\u0026rsquo;s input is around 12.3 EV most of the time. Decrease this value even more if setting the black relative exposure in filmic to \u0026ndash;16 EV fails to unclip blacks.\n🔗reconstruct This tab provides controls that blend transitions between unclipped and clipped areas within an image and can also help to reconstruct colors from adjacent pixels. It is designed to handle spotlights that could not possibly be unclipped when taking the shot (such as naked light bulbs or the sun disc in the frame) and aims at diffusing their edges as film would do. It is not designed to recover large areas of clipped pixels or in-paint missing parts of the image.\nIt can sometimes be useful to disable the highlight reconstruction module in order to provide additional data to the reconstruction algorithm (highlight reconstruction clips highlight data by default). You should note that this can lead to magenta highlights, which will need to be handled with the gray/colorful details slider.\nFirstly, a mask needs to be set up to identify the parts of the image that will be affected by the highlights reconstruction. There are then some additional controls to fine-tune some of the trade-offs made by the reconstruction algorithm.\n🔗highlights clipping These controls allow you to choose which areas of the image are impacted by the highlight reconstruction algorithms.\nenable highlight reconstruction Highlight reconstruction is disabled by default (for performance reasons \u0026ndash; it should only be enabled when required). Use this option to enable it. Highlight reconstruction is also automatically enabled if the threshold or transition sliders are adjusted. threshold Any pixels brighter than this threshold will be affected by the reconstruction algorithm. The units are in EV, relative to the white point set in the scene tab. To use the highlights reconstruction feature, click the display highlight reconstruction mask icon to show the mask, and alter this threshold until the highlight areas you want to reconstruct are selected in white by the mask. It may be useful to first review the image using the raw overexposed warning to show you which pixels in the raw file have been clipped, and whether those pixels are clipped on just one RGB channel or all of them. transition Use this control to soften the transition between clipped and valid pixels. Moving this control to the right will increase the amount of blur in the mask, so that the transition between clipped and non-clipped areas is softer. This allows for a smoother blending between the clipped and non-clipped regions. Moving this control to the left will reduce the blur in the mask, making the transition in the mask much sharper and therefore reducing the amount of feathering between clipped and non-clipped areas. display highlight reconstruction mask Click on the icon to the right of this label to toggle the display of the highlight reconstruction mask. It is recommended that you turn this on while adjusting the above controls. 🔗balance These controls allow you to balance the trade-offs between the various reconstruction algorithms.\nstructure ↔ texture Use this to control whether the reconstruction algorithm should favor painting in a smooth color gradient (structure), or trying to reconstruct the texture using sharp details extracted from unclipped pixel data (texture). By default, the control is in the middle at 0%, which favors both strategies equally. If you have lots of areas where all three channels are clipped, there is no texture detail available to reconstruct, so it is better to move the slider to the left to favor color reconstruction. If you have lots of areas where only one or two channels are clipped, then there may be some texture detail in the unclipped channel(s), and moving the slider to the right will place more emphasis on trying to reconstruct texture using this unclipped data. bloom ↔ reconstruct Use this to control whether the algorithm tries to reconstruct sharp detail in the clipped areas (reconstruct), or apply a blur that approximates the blooming effect you get with traditional film (bloom). By default, this is set to 100%, which tries to maximise the sharpness of the detail in the clipped areas. Move this slider to the left if you want to introduce more blur in these areas. Introducing more blur will usually tend to darken the highlights as a by-product, which may lead to a more colorful reconstruction. gray ↔ colorful details Use this to control whether the algorithm favors the recovery of monochromatic highlights (gray) or colorful details. Move the slider to the right if you want more color in the highlights. Move the slider to the left if you want to reduce the saturation of the highlights. It can be helpful to reduce the saturation in the highlights if you start seeing magenta or out-of-gamut colors. 🔗look When working on the look tab, it is recommended that you monitor the S-curve spline on the look only graph. This curve starts from the scene/display black levels at the bottom left of the graph, and should smoothly increase up to the scene/display white levels at the top right. Sometimes, if the constraints on the S-curve are too tight, the splines in the shadows and/or highlights regions can \u0026ldquo;overshoot\u0026rdquo; the limits of the display, and an orange warning is shown on those parts of the spline.\nIf you see the orange warning indicator at either end of the S-curve, corrective actions should be performed to bring the S-curve back to a smooth monotonically increasing curve. This may involve:\nreducing the latitude and/or contrast,\nadjusting the shadows/highlights slider to shift the latitude and allow more room for the spline,\nensuring that the scene-referred black and white relative exposure sliders on the scene tab have been properly set for the characteristics of the scene,\nsetting one or both of the contrast settings on the options tab to safe or hard.\nIf the target black luminance setting on the display tab is non-zero, this can also make it difficult for filmic rgb to find a smooth monotonic spline, and reducing this can also help to relax the constraints. See the display section to understand the implications of this.\ncontrast The filmic S-curve is created by computing the position of virtual nodes from the module parameters and interpolating them. This is similar to how the tone curve module operates, but here, the nodes cannot be moved manually. The curve is split into three parts \u0026ndash; a middle linear part, and two extremities that transition smoothly from the slope of the middle part to the ends of the exposure range. The contrast slider controls the slope of the middle part of the curve, as illustrated in the graph display. The larger the dynamic range, the greater the contrast should be set to, in order preserve a natural-looking image. This parameter mostly affects the mid-tones. Note that global contrast has an impact on the acutance (perceived sharpness) \u0026ndash; a low-contrast image will look unsharp even though it is optically sharp in the sense of the Optical Transfer Function (OTF).\nSetting the contrast to 1 almost completely disables the S-curve, though there will be a very small residual effect from the splines in the highlights and shadows.\nhardness (previously target power factor function) Known as the target power factor function slider in older versions of filmic rgb, this slider is hidden by default, and is adjusted automatically based on values in the scene tab. To make this slider visible, you need to uncheck auto adjust hardness in the options tab. This parameter is the power function applied to the output transfer function, and it is often improperly called the gamma (which can mean too many things in imaging applications, so we should stop using that term). It is used to raise or compress the mid-tones to account for display non-linearities or to avoid quantization artifacts when encoding in 8 bit file formats. This is a common operation when applying ICC color profiles (except for linear RGB spaces, like Rec. 709 or Rec. 2020, which have a linear “gamma” of 1.0). However, at the output of filmic rgb, the signal is logarithmically encoded, which is not something ICC color profiles know to handle. As a consequence, if we let them apply a gamma of 1/2.2 on top, it will result in a double-up, which would cause the middle-gray to be remapped to 76% instead of 45% as it should in display-referred space.\nlatitude The latitude is the range between the two nodes enclosing the central linear portion of the curve, expressed as a percentage of the dynamic range defined in the scene tab (white relative exposure minus black relative exposure). It is the luminance range that is remapped in priority, and it is remapped to the luminance interval defined by the contrast parameter. If clipping is observed when increasing the latitude, you can compensate by either decreasing the latitude, shifting the latitude interval with the shadow ↔ highlights balance parameter, or decreasing the contrast. The latitude also defines the range of luminances that are not desaturated at the extremities of the luminance range (See mid-tones saturation).\nshadows ↔ highlights balance By default, the latitude is centered in the middle of the dynamic range. If this produces clipping at one end of the curve, the balance parameter allows you to slide the latitude along the slope, towards the shadows or towards the highlights. This allows more room to be given to one extremity of the dynamic range than to the other, if the properties of the image demand it. highlights saturation mix At extreme luminances, pixels will tend towards either white or black. Because neither white nor black have color associated with them, the saturation of these pixels must be 0%. In order to gracefully transition towards this 0% saturation point, pixels outside the mid-tone latitude range are progressively desaturated as they approach the extremes. This setting controls how that is achieved. Positive values ensure that saturation is kept unchanged over the entire tonal range. Negative values bleach highlights at constant hue and luminance. Zero is an equal mix of both strategies. This control is set to 0 by default and should normally be left unchanged as you are now advised to handle saturation earlier in the pipeline \u0026ndash; a preset \u0026ldquo;add basic colorfulness\u0026rdquo; has been added to the color balance rgb module for this purpose. Note: The highlights saturation mix control has changed a number of times as the developer refined its functionality. The above description documents the current version (v7), which is the default and recommended version to use. In earlier versions, this control had different names (\u0026ldquo;extreme luminance saturation\u0026rdquo; in v3 and v6, \u0026ldquo;mid-tones saturation\u0026rdquo; in versions 4-5), and filmic\u0026rsquo;s graph also included a darker \u0026ldquo;desaturation curve\u0026rdquo; indicating the amount of desaturation applied to pixels outside the latitude range. You can still access older versions by changing the \u0026ldquo;color science\u0026rdquo; setting in the options tab. For more information on the operation of this control in older versions please see the tooltips that are displayed when you hover over the slider within darktable.\n🔗display The parameters in this tab should rarely require adjustment.\ntarget black luminance The destination parameters set the target luminance values used to remap the tones. The default parameters should work 99% of the time, the remaining 1% being when you output in linear RGB space (Rec. 709, Rec. 2020) for media handling log-encoded data. These settings should therefore be used with caution because darktable does not allow separate pipelines for display preview and file output. The target black luminance parameter sets the ground-level black of the target medium. By default it is set to the minimum non-zero value that can be encoded by the available number of bits in the output color space. Reducing it to zero means that some non-zero luminances will be mapped to 0 in the output, potentially losing some detail in the very darkest parts of the shadows. Increasing this slider will produce raised, faded blacks that can provide something of a \u0026ldquo;retro\u0026rdquo; look.\ntarget middle-gray (hidden by default) This is the middle-gray of the output medium that is used as a target for the S-curve\u0026rsquo;s central node. On gamma-corrected media, the actual gray is computed with the gamma correction (middle-gray^(1/gamma)), so a middle-gray parameter of 18% with a gamma of 2.2 gives an actual middle-gray target of 45.87%. This control is hidden by default as it is essentially a duplication of the exposure control within the exposure module. You should use this module to set an appropriate mid-gray value before tone mapping with filmic rgb. target white luminance This parameter allows you to set the ceiling level white of the target medium. Set it lower than 100% if you want dampened, muted whites to achieve a retro look. To avoid double-ups and washed-out images, filmic rgb applies a “gamma” compression reverting the output ICC gamma correction, so the middle-gray is correctly remapped at the end. To remove this compression, set the destination power factor to 1.0 and the middle-gray destination to 45%.\n🔗options color science This setting defaults to v7 (2023) for new images, and defines the algorithms used by the filmic rgb module (e.g. the extreme luminance desaturation strategy). To revert to the behavior of previous versions of filmic rgb, set this parameter to v3 (2019), v4 (2020) or v5 (2021). The difference between these methods lies in the way in which they handle desaturation close to pure black and pure white (see the background section for details). If you have previously edited an image using older versions of filmic rgb, the color science setting will be kept at the earlier version number in order to provide backward compatibility for those edits. v7 (2023) removes the preserve chrominance option (see background). preserve chrominance (not available with color science v7) Define how the chrominance should be handled by filmic rgb \u0026ndash; either not at all, or using one of the four provided norms. When applying the S-curve transformation independently on each color, the proportions of the colors are modified, which modifies the properties of the underlying spectrum, and ultimately the chrominance of the image. This is what happens if you choose \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; in the preserve chrominance parameter. This value may yield seemingly “better” results than the other values, but it may negatively impact later parts of the pipeline, for example, when it comes to global saturation.\nThe other values of this parameter all work in a similar way. Instead of applying the S-curve to the R, G and B channels independently, filmic rgb, divides all the three components by a norm (N), and applies the S-curve to N. This way, the relationship between the channels is preserved.\nThe value of the preserve chrominance parameter indicates which norm is used (the value used for N):\nno means that the ratios between the RGB channels are not preserved. This will tend to saturate the shadows and desaturate the highlights, and can be helpful when there are out-of-gamut blues or reds. max RGB is the maximum value of the R, G and B channels. This is the same behaviour as the original version of the filmic rgb module. It tends to darken the blues, especially skies, and to yield halos or fringes, especially if some channels are clipped. It can also flatten the local contrast somewhat. luminance Y is a linear combination of the R, G and B channels. It tends to darken and increase local contrast in the reds, and tends not to behave so well with saturated and out-of-gamut blues. RGB power norm is the sum of the cubes of the R, G, and B channels, divided by the sum of their squares (R³ + G³ + B³)/(R² + G² + B²). It is usually a good compromise between the max RGB and the luminance Y values. RGB euclidean norm has the property of being RGB-space-agnostic, so it will yield the same results regardless of which working color profile is used. It weighs more heavily on highlights than the power norm and gives more highlights desaturation, and is probably the closest to a color film look. There is no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; choice for the norm, and the appropriate choice depends strongly on the image to which it is applied. You are advised to experiment and decide for yourself which setting gives the most pleasing result with the fewest artifacts.\ncontrast in highlights This control selects the desired curvature at the highlights end of the filmic rgb spline curve. Selecting safe is guaranteed not to over- or under-shoot but has quite muted contrast near white. The default setting (hard) places a tighter constraint on the slope of the spline, which makes the curve sharper and hence introduces more tonal compression in the highlights. Selecting soft loosens this constraint, resulting in a gentler curve with less tonal compression in the highlights. contrast in shadows This control selects the desired curvature at the shadows end of the filmic rgb spline curve. Selecting safe is guaranteed not to over- or under-shoot but has quite muted contrast near black. The default setting (hard) places a tighter constraint on the slope of the spline, which makes the curve sharper and hence introduces more tonal compression in the shadows. Selecting soft loosens this constraint, resulting in a gentler curve with less tonal compression in the shadows. use custom middle-gray values Enabling this setting makes the middle-gray luminance slider visible on the scene tab. With the current version of filmic rgb, you are advised to use the exposure module to set the middle-gray level, so this setting is disabled by default (and the middle-gray luminance slider is hidden). auto-adjust hardness By default, this setting is enabled, and filmic rgb will automatically calculate the power function (aka \u0026ldquo;gamma\u0026rdquo;) to be applied on the output transfer curve. If this setting is disabled, a hardness slider will appear on the look tab so that value can be manually set. iterations of high-quality reconstruction Use this setting to increase the number of passes of the highlight reconstruction algorithm. More iterations means more color propagation into clipped areas from pixels in the surrounding neighbourhood. This can produce more neutral highlights, but it also costs more in terms of processing power. It can be useful in difficult cases where there are magenta highlights due to channel clipping. The default reconstruction works on separate RGB channels and has only one iteration applied, whereas the high quality reconstruction uses a different algorithm that works on RGB ratios (which is a way of breaking down chromaticity from luminance) and can use several iterations to gradually propagate colors from neighbouring pixels into clipped areas. However, if too many iterations are used, the reconstruction can degenerate, which will result in far colors being improperly inpainted into clipped objects (color bleeding) \u0026ndash; for example white clouds being inpainted with blue sky, or the sun disc shot through trees being inpainted with leaf-green.\nadd noise in highlights This artificially introduces noise into the reconstructed highlights to prevent them from looking too smooth compared to surrounding areas that may already contain noise. This can help to blend the reconstructed areas more naturally with the surrounding non-clipped areas. type of noise This specifies the statistical distribution of the added noise. It can be helpful to match the look of the artificially generated noise with the naturally occurring noise in the surrounding areas from the camera\u0026rsquo;s sensor. The poissonian noise is the closest to natural sensor noise but is less visually pleasing than gaussian, which is probably closer to film grain. Also note that most denoising modules will turn the sensor noise from poissonian to slightly gaussian, so you should pick the variant that blends better into the actual noise in your image. 🔗background The color science parameter (in the options tab) defines the strategy that is used to desaturate colors near pure white (maximum display emission) and pure black (minimum display emission). The problem can be explained with the graph below, which represents the gamut of the sRGB color space at the constant hue of its green primary, with varying lightness (vertical axis) and chroma (horizontal axis):\nAs we approach pure black and pure white, the chroma available in gamut shrinks considerably until it reaches zero for lightness = 0 and lightness = 100% of the medium emission. This means that very bright (or very dark) colors cannot be very saturated at the same time if we want them to fit in gamut, with the gamut being imposed by the printing or displaying device we use.\nIf colors are left unmanaged and are allowed to escape gamut, they will be clipped to valid values at the time of conversion to display color space. The problem is that this clipping is generally not hue-preserving and definitely not luminance-preserving, so highlights will typically shift to yellow and appear darker than they should, when evaluated against their neighborhood.\nTo overcome this, filmic has used various strategies over the years (the so-called color sciences) to desaturate extreme luminances, forcing a zero saturation at minimum and maximum lightness and a smooth desaturation gradient. These strategies were all intended to minimize the hue shifts that come with gamut clipping.\nSince all of these strategies were approximations (and often over-conservative ones) v6 (2022) introduces a more accurate and measured approach. It performs a test-conversion to display color space, checks if the resulting color fits within the [0; 100]% range, and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, computes the maximum saturation available in gamut at this luminance and hue, finally clipping the color to this value. This ensures a minimal color distortion, allowing for more saturated colors and better use of the available gamut, but also enforces a constant hue throughout the whole tone mapping and gamut mapping operation.\nThis gamut mapping uses the output color profile as a definition of the display color space and automatically adjusts to any output space. However, only matrix or matrix + curve(s) ICC profiles are supported. LUT ICC profiles are not supported and, if used, will make the gamut mapping default to the pipeline working space (Rec. 2020 by default).\nNote that the hue used as a reference for the gamut mapping is the hue before any tone mapping, sampled at the input of filmic. This means that even the none chrominance preservation mode (applied on individual RGB channels regardless of their ratios) preserves hue in v6. This mode will only desaturate highlights more than the other modes, and a mechanism is in place to prevent it from resaturating shadows \u0026ndash; this behaviour can be bypassed by increasing the extreme luminance saturation setting.\nv7 (2023) improves over v6 (2022) by replacing the chroma preservation methods with a single slider. Chroma preservation methods aim at anchoring saturation and hue across the tone-mapping operation, by preserving RGB ratios compared to a norm. The choice of norm is important when it comes to managing how the gamut is used and how the contrast of bright objects (relative to their neighborhood) is rendered by the tone-mapper. Several norms have been proposed since filmic v1 (2018), none being objectively better and only one of which (max RGB) has some theoretical justification (allowing display peak primary colors to be reached after the transform).\nThe approach in v7 is to offer a mix between the max RGB norm and the no-preservation option (where the output hue and saturation are still forced to their input values). The proportions of the mix are driven by the highlights saturation mix setting as follows:\n-50% is strictly equivalent to the v6 no-preservation option, +50% is strictly equivalent to the v6 max RGB option, 0% is an average of no-preservation and max RGB, intermediate values are weighted averages between no-preservation and max RGB, values beyond ±50% (up to ±200%) are linear extrapolations. Positive values favor saturated highlights and are generally suitable for skies, but need to be handled with care for portraits (producing accurate skin tones), whereas negative values favor bleaching of highlights.\nThe highlights saturation mix slider provides fine control over the amount of saturation vs. bleaching expected in the highlights. Regardless of this setting, the saturation algorithm will never permit the output saturation to be higher than the input saturation. This setting is not designed for creative purposes, but only to drive the complicated trade-off that comes from remapping RGB values from one color space to another, each having different gamuts and dynamic ranges.\n🔗caveats 🔗color artifacts As filmic versions 6 and 7 are so far the best approach for retaining saturated colors at constant hue, they are also much less forgiving to invalid colors like chromatic aberrations and clipped magenta highlights, which are much better hidden (albeit not solved) by simple curves applied on individual channels (no chrominance preservation) with no care given to their ratios.\nIt is not the purpose of a tone mapping and gamut mapping operators to reconstruct damaged signals, and these flaws need to be corrected earlier in the pipeline with the specialized modules provided. However, there is a mechanism in filmic v6 that ensures that any color brighter than the white relative exposure degrades to pure white, so a quick workaround is to simply set the white relative exposure to a value slightly lower than the exposure of the clipped parts. In other words: if it is clipped at the input, let it be clipped at the output. Chrominance preservation options that work the best for this purpose are the luminance and euclidean norms, or simply none.\n🔗inconsistent output With filmic v6, if you export the same image to sRGB and Adobe RGB color spaces, and then compare both images side by side on a large-gamut screen (that can cover Adobe RGB), the sRGB export should have more desaturated highlights than the Adobe RGB version. Since the sRGB color space is shorter than Adobe RGB, its gamut boundary is closer to the neutral grey axis, and therefore the maximum allowed chroma is lower for any given luminance. This is by no means a bug but rather is proof that the gamut mapping is actually doing its job.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/filmic-rgb/","tags":null,"title":"filmic rgb"},{"categories":null,"content":"Generate a frame around the image.\nThe frame consists of a border (with a user-defined color) and a frame line within that border (with a second user-defined color).

Once a pixel is clipped we can no longer know the precise brightness of that pixel \u0026ndash; only that it is equal to or greater than the maximum value that pixel can store.\nIdeally, the photosite saturation point would be the same as the value at which digital clipping occurs (to make maximum use of the camera\u0026rsquo;s dynamic range) but these values often differ between cameras. Darktable uses a camera\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;white point\u0026rdquo; to determine whether or not a given channel is clipped. If the white point is set incorrectly for a given camera, this can lead to valid pixels being clipped and can adversely impact the effectiveness of this module.\nWhen a camera captures light (using a normal Bayer sensor) each pixel represents a single color (R,G,B), which is then interpolated by the demosaic module to calculate the color of neighboring pixels. The result will often be pixels (in the demosaiced image) that are clipped in some (R,G,B) channels but not others.\nIf these pixels are left partially clipped it can result in unrealistic colors appearing in the image. These incorrect colors can then be further skewed by the white balance module, which adjusts the ratios of the R, G, and B channels to account for the overall color of the scene. For example, where only the G channel is clipped (and R and B are close to clipping) the white balance module can cause the R and B channels to be adjusted above the clipping point of the G channel leading to pink highlights that would otherwise have been white.\nThe crude method to resolve this is to clip the R and B channels to the clipping point of the G channel (the \u0026ldquo;clip highlights\u0026rdquo; reconstruction method), but this can result in the loss of valid pixel data that may be useful in highlight reconstruction, and may also cause other artifacts and hue shifts.\n🔗highlight reconstruction methods A number of highlight reconstruction methods are provided within this module. These methods all use unclipped channels and/or adjacent pixels to reconstruct the missing data.\ninpaint opposed (default) Restore clipped pixels by using an average of adjacent unclipped pixels to estimate the correct color. This works well for the majority of images but may fail where the clipped areas are adjacent to areas of a different color. segmentation based A more sophisticated algorithm that uses adjacent unclipped pixels to estimate the correct color, by treating each clipped area separately (as an individual segment). The color of each clipped segment is estimated by analysing the color ratios of the adjacent pixels. Pixels that are too dark or appear to be an edge are rejected by the algorithm. If all surrounding pixels are rejected, that segment is reconstructed using the \u0026ldquo;inpaint opposed\u0026rdquo; method (above). Segments that are close together are often parts of the same object and so can be treated as if they were a single segment. Segmentation based reconstruction is able to rebuild large areas where all channels are clipped by examining the surrounding gradients. However, you should think of this method more as a way to \u0026ldquo;disguise\u0026rdquo; clipped areas with something plausible, rather than a way to \u0026ldquo;magically\u0026rdquo; repair them.\nguided laplacians Use an algorithm (derived from the diffuse or sharpen module) to replicate details from valid channels into clipped channels and to propagate color gradients from valid surrounding regions into clipped regions. This is a computationally-intensive method designed for maximum smoothness and seamless blending of the reconstructed regions into their neighborhood, and is designed primarily to reconstruct spotlights and specular reflections. This mode is available for Bayer sensors only. clip highlights Clamp all pixels to the white level (i.e. clip the remaining color channels). This method is most useful in cases where clipped highlights occur in naturally desaturated objects (e.g. clouds). reconstruct in LCh Analyse each pixel with at least one clipped channel and attempt to correct the clipped pixel (in LCh color space) using the values of the other (3 for Bayer or 8 for X-Trans) pixels in the affected sensor block. The reconstructed highlights will still be monochrome, but brighter and with more detail than with “clip highlights”. This method works fairly well with a high-contrast base curve, which renders highlights desaturated. As with clip highlights this method is a good option for naturally desaturated objects. Note: When using the highlight reconstruction included with the filmic rgb module it may be better to avoid using this module in clip highlights mode (so that filmic rgb has more information to work with).\n🔗module controls 🔗common controls method The method used to reconstruct highlights. clipping threshold Pixels above this value are considered to be clipped. clipping mask Click the icon beside the slider to visualise what areas of the image are considered to be clipped (the clipping mask). If the clipping mask does not match the RAW overexposed warning, you may need to correct this value. Note: The clipping mask is also available as a raster mask for use in subsequent modules. This can be used, for example, to manage any color cast that remains after highlight reconstruction.\n🔗\u0026ldquo;guided laplacians\u0026rdquo; mode noise level Add Poisson noise (natural photon noise such as you would find in sensor readings) to the clipped regions. For high-ISO images, the valid regions of the image will be noisy, but the reconstructed clipped areas will be smooth, which may look odd. Adding some noise in the reconstruction helps to visually blend the result with the rest of the image. iterations The guided laplacians mode is an iterative process that extrapolates gradients and details from the neighborhood. Each new iteration refines the previous reconstruction but adds more computations that will make the module slower. The default number of iterations should provide reasonable results but you can increase if magenta highlights are not completely recovered \u0026ndash; increase this parameter gradually but carefully, to manage the speed/quality trade-off. inpaint a flat color Inpainting a flat color is an algorithmic trick that may help recover magenta highlights in difficult cases (large blown areas) by smoothing RGB ratios. It can be seen as a \u0026ldquo;reconstruction booster\u0026rdquo; that may reduce the number of iterations required to entirely remove magenta in clipped highlights. However, this also makes the reconstruction less accurate and can lead to non-smooth reconstructed edges and unrelated colors being inpainted (e.g. blue sky or green leaves bleeding into white clouds). Use this setting with caution. diameter of the reconstruction The guided laplacians mode uses a multi-scale algorithm that tries to recover details from each scale independently. The diameter of the reconstruction is the largest scale used by the algorithm. Large scales will increase memory consumption as well as runtimes, and may also cause unrelated colors or details to be inpainted in clipped regions. You are advised to use a diameter roughly twice as large as the largest clipped area to be reconstructed. It is also possible that a given diameter may not suit all clipped areas, in which case you should use several instances at different scales and mask the clipped areas accordingly. 🔗\u0026ldquo;segmentation based\u0026rdquo; mode clipping threshold Since this controls the locations of pixels that are considered to be clipped, it also changes the size of the resulting segments and the location of the adjacent pixels used for the reconstruction. For accurate adjustment, you can use the exposure module to ensure that no highlights are clipped in the histogram (or the image you see on screen). Then raise the clipping threshold until the highlights are no longer white and slowly lower it again until they look acceptable. combine The radius at which close segments are combined and considered to be part of the same segment. Increase (to combine more segments) when different parts of the same object have been incorrectly reconstructed to different colors. Decrease (to separate segments) when different objects have been incorrectly reconstructed to the same color. Click on the button beside the slider to see the outlines of the resulting segments. candidating Choose whether to prefer choosing candidate pixels (used to obtain color data) with segmentation analysis (high values) or inpaint opposed (low values). Click the button beside the slider to show the segments that are considered to have good candidates. rebuild Choose how to rebuild areas that have all channels clipped. The \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; modes are tuned for segment sizes less than 25 and greater than 100 pixels in diameter, respectively. The \u0026ldquo;flat\u0026rdquo; modes attempt to ignore narrow un-clipped features (powerlines, branches) to avoid gradients. Finally, the \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; modes attempt to find the best settings for each segment. 🔗\u0026ldquo;guided laplacians\u0026rdquo; mode and filmic\u0026rsquo;s highlight reconstruction It is important to note that the highlight reconstruction module is quite early in the pixel pipeline \u0026ndash; before input color profile and the full chromatic adaptation in color calibration (if you use the modern chromatic adaptation workflow). A common trick to solve clipped highlights is to simply desaturate them to white but, because white is not defined before the full chromatic adaptation and the input color profiling, it is not possible to use this trick here. Technically, there is no color yet at this point in the pipeline, only an arbitrary 3D signal.\nThe guided laplacians approach has been designed specifically to be immune to white-balance discrepancies and to avoid any concept or method related to color (so there is no explicit desaturation). It only handles gradients (transitions) in the signal and aims at connecting them smoothly, in order to fill the missing parts. This process is quite heavy though, since it falls into the category of supervised machine learning (gradient-based optimization through multi-scale curvature), which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence.\nFilmic\u0026rsquo;s highlight reconstruction uses a simpler color propagation algorithm coupled with a desaturation option that can favor an achromatic reconstruction. Not only does it know about color (because it comes after the full color profiling and chromatic adaptation) but it also uses a simplified and faster version of the algorithm used by the guided laplacians approach. Namely, this variant will not try as hard to restore details and will favor a smooth blur instead.\nThe filmic reconstruction is good enough for very large clipped patches and offers the benefit of being able to degrade to white as a last resort. It is also better and faster to inpaint solid color into clipped areas, at the expense of details. Its main drawback is that it is not as selective in the source of the colors being inpainted in clipped parts, so it may inpaint unrelated colors.\nAll in all, you are advised to use the guided laplacians highlight reconstruction mode to:\nsmooth the boundaries of clipped areas, recover spotlights and clipped areas of diameter below approximately 256px (on the full-resolution RAW), remove chromatic aberrations, which can occur during demosaicing (the next module in the pipeline) at the boundary between clipped and valid regions. If you find yourself having to increase the diameter of reconstruction past 512px to get a full recovery from magenta, the best approach is usually to cap the diameter to 512px, do the most you can with this setting, and then enable filmic\u0026rsquo;s highlight reconstruction to finish the work. This will give more bearable run-times with a very similar result.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/highlight-reconstruction/","tags":null,"title":"highlight reconstruction"},{"categories":null,"content":"A high pass filter.\nThis module is primarily intended to be used in combination with a blend mode.

This means that subsequent modules in the pipeline don\u0026rsquo;t need to be concerned with the specifics of the input device, and can work with and convert to/from a common working color space.\nWhere an image has been captured in a raw file, the input color profile module will normally apply either a standard or enhanced color matrix specific for that camera model, which will be used to map the colors into the working profile color space. If color space information is embedded in the image, the input color profile module will use this information when mapping the colors to the working profile color space. The user can also explicitly specify a color space for the incoming image, and can even supply a custom ICC color profile specifically made for the input device.\nAs part of the mapping from the input color space to the working profile space, the colors can be confined to a certain gamut using the gamut clipping options, which can help to mitigate some (infrequent) color artifacts. This is also influenced by the chosen rendering intent.\nNote that the final color profile that will be used when exporting the image is controlled by the output color profile module.\n🔗module controls input profile The profile or color matrix to apply. A number of matrices are provided along with an enhanced color matrix for some camera models. The enhanced matrices are designed to provide a look that is closer to that of the camera manufacturer. You can also supply your own input ICC profiles and put them into $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/in or $HOME/.config/darktable/color/in (where $DARKTABLE is the darktable installation directory and $HOME is your home directory). Note that these color/in directories are not created by the darktable install; if you need to use one, you must create it yourself. One common source of ICC profiles is the software that is shipped with your camera, which often contains profiles specific to your camera model. You may need to activate the unbreak input profile module to use your own profiles.\nIf your input image is a low dynamic range file like JPEG, or a raw file in DNG format, it might already contain an embedded ICC profile, which darktable will use by default. You can restore this default by selecting “embedded icc profile”. If you hover your mouse over the input profile combobox on such an image, details of the embedded profile will be shown in a tooltip.\nworking profile The working profile used by darktable\u0026rsquo;s processing modules. Each module can specify an alternative space that it will work in, and this will trigger a conversion. By default darktable will use \u0026ldquo;linear Rec. 2020 RGB\u0026rdquo;, which is a good choice in most cases. gamut clipping Activate a color clipping mechanism. In most cases you can leave this control in its default “off” state. However, if your image shows some specific features such as highly saturated blue light sources, gamut clipping might be useful to avoid black pixel artifacts. See possible color artifacts for more information. Choose from a list of RGB profiles. Input colors with a saturation that exceeds the permissible range of the selected profile are automatically clipped to a maximum value. “linear Rec. 2020 RGB” and “Adobe RGB (compatible)” allow for a broader range of unclipped colors, while “sRGB” and “linear Rec. 709 RGB” produce a tighter clipping.

A low value pulls the highlights down. shadows Similar to the highlights parameter, this affects the other end of the contrast curve, and increases or decreases contrast in the shadows. A higher value gives more contrast in the shadows. A lower value lifts the shadows and can effectively simulate a fill light. Note that this is done with local manipulation of the image. However, this means that a completely dark image cannot be brightened in this way \u0026ndash; only dark objects in front of bright objects are affected. mid-tone range This controls the extent of the S shaped part of the contrast curve. A larger value makes the S wider, and thus classifies more values as mid-tones and fewer values as highlights and shadows. In higher dynamic range settings it can be useful to reduce this value to achieve stronger range compression, by lowering the contrast in the highlights and the shadows. Note however, that for really strong HDR scenarios this may work best in combination with a base curve that pre-compresses the range, perhaps with an approximately logarithmic curve. The exposure fusion feature in the base curve module may lead to more pleasing results at times, but is also more prone to halo effects.

Some modules are essential for image processing and cannot be disabled (though their parameters may be amended). Similarly, some modules are not applicable for certain types of image and cannot be enabled. Ctrl+click on the on/off button to toggle whether the module has focus. The focus state is usually used to activate any overlays that a module places over the image to control its functionality. For example, the crop module only shows the composition and crop guide lines on the image if it has focus. Modules are automatically given focus when expanded.\nmodule name The module name consists of a description of the module\u0026rsquo;s operation (which cannot be changed) followed by the module\u0026rsquo;s instance name (which can). By default the first instance of a module has an empty instance name. If you create additional instances, the name of each new instance is initiated with a unique integer.

You can take a profiling image of the light source with no film negative in front of it, and then use the \u0026ldquo;from image area\u0026rdquo; feature in the white balance module to obtain a reference white-balance setting. This reference white balance setting can then be made into a style or simply pasted onto the images taken from your film negatives.\nApply the standard or enhanced camera matrix in the input color profile module.\nWhen scanning or photographing your film negative, make sure you include some unexposed part of the film within the captured image. This is required to set the Dmin parameter (see below). If this is not possible (e.g. your film holder completely obscures the unexposed parts of the film), you can take a separate image of an unexposed part of the film, measure the Dmin parameter from that image, and then paste that setting to the rest of the images from that film.\nWhen developing the scanned/photographed film negatives, it is recommended that you disable any tone mapping modules such as filmic rgb and base curve.\nThe working profile parameter in darktable\u0026rsquo;s input color profile module should be set to either linear Rec. 2020 RGB, or to an ICC profile representing the actual color space of your film emulsion. Some examples of such ICC profiles may be found in the following forum posts:\nhttps://discuss.pixls.us/t/any-interest-in-a-film-negative-feature-in-rt/12569/177\nhttps://discuss.pixls.us/t/input-color-profile-to-use-for-negatives/20271/13\nNote: if you want to use the tone equalizer with negadoctor, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to move the tone equalizer module after negadoctor in the pixelpipe, since the tone equalizer is not designed to work with negatives.\n🔗module controls It is strongly recommended that you set the parameters following the order in which they are presented in the GUI. Start by setting the film stock, then work through each of the tabs (film properties, corrections, print properties) in order, working from top to bottom in each tab.\nWhen using pickers, be careful to avoid including dust and scratches, which can skew the data taken from the sampled region.\nfilm stock The first step is to choose \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;black and white\u0026rdquo; in the film stock drop-down. If you select \u0026ldquo;black and white\u0026rdquo;, any sliders that are only used for color will be hidden from view. 🔗film properties This tab contains a number of basic settings. If, after adjusting these settings, your image is still not quite as you would like it, you can make further adjustments on the corrections tab. These are technical settings, and serve a similar purpose to the scene tab in the filmic rgb module, in that they adjust the black and white points and hence define the dynamic range of the negative.\ncolor of the film base Sample an area of the base film stock from your scan. This is the area just outside of the image (an unexposed part of the film). If you are working with black and white negatives, you can leave this slider at its default value (white). If working on color film, click the picker to the right of the color bar, which will create a bounding box covering about 98% of your image. Then, click and drag across an area of your negative which contains only unexposed film stock. This will automatically calculate values for the D min slider(s). It is likely at this point that your image will still look too dark, but you can correct this later. D min If the film stock is set to \u0026ldquo;black and white\u0026rdquo;, this slider indicates the minimum value corresponding to the unexposed film stock. If the film stock is set to \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo;, this control will consist of 3 separate sliders, one for each of the red, green and blue channels. D max This slider represents the dynamic range of your film, and it effectively sets the film\u0026rsquo;s white point. Dragging this slider to the left will make the negative brighter. Dragging it to the right will make the negative darker. When adjusting this slider manually, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to closely watch your histogram to ensure that you don\u0026rsquo;t clip the highlights (where the histogram has been pushed over too far off the right hand side of the graph). If you click the picker icon (on the right) negadoctor will automatically calculate this value to ensure maximal use of the histogram without clipping. To use the picker, click and drag to draw a rectangle across only the exposed parts of the negative. Don\u0026rsquo;t include the unexposed film stock, as this will skew the result. scan exposure bias This slider allows you to set the black point. It is a technical adjustment that ensures a proper zeroing of the RGB values and a spreading of the histogram between [0, 1] values for robustness in the operations that follow. Dragging this to the left will make the negative brighter. Dragging to the right will make the negative darker. When adjusting this slider manually, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to closely watch your histogram to ensure that you don\u0026rsquo;t clip the shadows (where the histogram is pushed too far off the left hand side of the graph). If you click the picker negadoctor will automatically calculate any required offset. To use the picker, select a region in the darkest lowlights, or select the entire image without including any unexposed film stock. Double-check the histogram to ensure the left part of it doesn\u0026rsquo;t clip. 🔗corrections This tab contains sliders that allow you to make color cast corrections within both the shadow and highlight regions.\nThe settings on this tab should not be needed for most well-preserved negatives. It is mostly useful for old and poorly-preserved negatives with a decayed film base that introduces undesirable color casts.\nThe other case where these color cast corrections may be needed is if the white balance properties of the light used to scan the film negative are significantly different to the light source under which the original film camera took the shot. For example, if you illuminate the film with an LED light, but the original shot was taken under daylight, this may require some additional color cast corrections.\nshadows color cast These three sliders allow you to correct for color casts in the shadows by adjusting the red, green and blue channels individually. Use the picker to set the sliders automatically by selecting a neutral gray shadow region requiring correction. Because the shadows sliders can also affect color casts in the highlights, it is important to finish setting the shadows sliders before moving on to the highlights sliders. highlights white balance These three sliders allow you to correct the white balance in the highlights by adjusting the red, green and blue channels individually. Use the picker to set the sliders automatically by selecting a neutral gray region in the highlights that is not properly balanced. 🔗print properties This tab contains settings that mimic the tonal effect of the photochemical papers that would have been used to create the hard copy image if you were not developing the photo digitally. These are creative settings, and serve a similar overall purpose to the creative tone curve settings on the look tab of the filmic rgb module.\nThe print exposure, paper black and paper grade are analogous to the slope, offset and power controls in the color balance module (which in turn is based on the ASC CDL standard). These settings define a creative tone curve to enforce your contrast intent after the inversion, at the end of the module. The equation governing this slope/offset/power behaviour is:\nRGB_out = ( RGB_in × exposure + black ) ᵍʳᵃᵈᵉ\npaper black (density correction) For this slider, select the picker and click and drag to select a region that encompasses only the exposed part of the film negative. If you can see unexposed film stock around the edges of your image, ensure that these areas are excluded from the drawn rectangle when calculating the paper black setting. Paper black represents the density of the blackest silver-halide crystal available on the virtual paper. In the analog development process, this black density always results in non-zero luminance, but the digital pipeline usually expects black to be encoded with a zero RGB value. This slider setting lets you remap paper black to pipeline black via an offset. You can use the picker to select a region of the image that should be mapped to black in the final image. paper grade (gamma) This slider is your gamma (contrast) control, and it defaults to a value of 4. If all has gone well, this value (4) minus the value of D max (from the “film properties” tab) should normally leave you with a value between 2 and 3. paper gloss (specular highlights) This slider is essentially a highlights compression tool. As you drag this slider to the left, you will see in the histogram that the highlight values are being compressed (pushed to the left). Adjust this accordingly, so that your highlights are not clipped in the histogram. You can also use this to simulate a matte photo print with low-contrast highlights. print exposure adjustment This slider offers one final opportunity to correct any clipping of the highlights. If you have followed all the previous instructions carefully, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to adjust this setting. Note that you can increase the print exposure while at the same time decreasing the paper gloss, which allows you to brighten the mid-tones without losing any highlights. You can use the picker to select the brightest highlights, or select the entire image without including any unexposed film stock. This will set the exposure so that the brightest part of the selected region is not clipped. Double-check the histogram to make sure that the right part of the histogram doesn\u0026rsquo;t clip.

This additional processing step is called blending \u0026ndash; input and output data is reprocessed using algorithms called blending operators or blend modes.\nEach blend mode is further controlled by the opacity parameter (having a value between 0% and 100%) which defines how much the input and output images contribute to the final result.

Higher values lead to stronger noise removal and greater loss of image detail. coarse/fine curves The noise of an image is usually a combination of fine-grained and coarse-grained noise. These curves allow the image to be denoised more or less depending on the coarseness of the visible noise. The left of the curve will act on very coarse grain noise, while the right of the curve will act on very fine grain noise. Raising the curve will result in more smoothing, while lowering it will result in less smoothing. As an example, you can preserve very fine-grained noise by pulling down the rightmost point of the curve to the minimum value.\nIf you are tackling chroma noise with a blend mode, you can raise the rightmost part of the curve quite high, as colors do not change a lot on fine grain scales. This will help especially if you see some isolated pixel left un-denoised.\nThe best way to use the R, G, and B curves is to examine each of the channels in turn using the color calibration module in gray mode, denoise that channel, and then repeat for the other channels. This way, you can take into account the fact that some channels may be noisier than others. Beware that guessing which channel is noisy without actually seeing the channels individually is not straightforward and can be counterintuitive. A pixel which is completely red may not be caused by noise on the R channel, but actually by noise on G and B channels.\nSee the wavelet section for more details.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/raw-denoise/","tags":null,"title":"raw denoise"},{"categories":null,"content":"Remove unwanted elements from your image by cloning, healing, blurring and filling using drawn shapes.\nThis module extends the capabilities of the deprecated spot removal module (equivalent to this module\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;clone\u0026rdquo; tool) by including a \u0026ldquo;heal\u0026rdquo; tool (based on the heal tool from GIMP), as well as \u0026ldquo;fill\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;blur\u0026rdquo; modes. It can also take advantage of wavelet decomposition, allowing the image to be separated into layers of varying detail (from coarse to fine) which can be selectively retouched before being recombined to produce the output image.\nAs you might want to use source data from any part of the image you will be shown the uncropped image (possibly with the cropping rectangle overlaid as a guide) while the module is active.\n🔗clone and heal Cloning allows a part of the image (the target) to be hidden by replacing it with an area copied from elsewhere in the image (the source). For example, you may wish to remove a small cloud from a blue sky:\nThe simplest way to do this is with the cloning tool . The following example uses a circular shape to clone out the cloud using the circle of blue sky beside it:\nIn many cases, the edges of the source shape won\u0026rsquo;t precisely match the surroundings of the target, leading to unnatural looking results. In this example, the sample of sky we chose as the source was slightly darker than the target, leaving a faint outline of the circular shape used in the cloning process:\nIn such cases, the heal tool is more appropriate. With this tool, the color and luma of the sample is blended to fit better with the surroundings. In this example, using heal instead of clone produces a much more pleasing result:\n🔗source and target shapes Once you have chosen heal or clone mode, you must choose the shape you wish to use (circle, ellipse, path or brush \u0026ndash; see the drawn masks section for details). The source and target patches will both use the same shape.\nWhen you hover over the image with your mouse, a plus symbol (+) will appear to indicate where the source shape will be placed by default. Your normal mouse cursor will indicate the position of the target shape:\nIt is recommended that you choose the position of the source shape first, followed by the position of the target, as follows:\nShift+click to set the position of the source shape in \u0026ldquo;relative mode\u0026rdquo;. The position of the \u0026ldquo;plus\u0026rdquo; (+) symbol will move to the clicked location and will remain in a fixed position relative to your cursor until you click on the image to begin placing your target shape. If you place subsequent shapes without first changing the target location, the source shape will be placed at the same offset from the target shape as was used for the first stroke.\nCtrl+Shift+click to change the position of the source shape in \u0026ldquo;absolute\u0026rdquo; mode. As above, the position of the \u0026ldquo;plus\u0026rdquo; (+) symbol will move to the clicked location, but will remain in the same absolute position even if you move your mouse. You can then click on the image to begin placing the target shape. If you place subsequent shapes without first changing the target location, exactly the same source position will be used, fixed in the absolute coordinate system of the image.\nOnce you have placed your source and target shapes on the image, they can be adjusted manually with your mouse.\nNote: For circle and ellipse shapes only, you can place both the source and target shapes with a single click-and-drag motion: Click on the desired target location and then drag, releasing your mouse button when you reach the desired source location. This operation does not affect the placement of subsequent shapes.\n🔗fill and blur The clone and heal tools both require the use of another part of the image to \u0026ldquo;fill in\u0026rdquo; the region being hidden. Sometimes there is no suitable sample in the image to use for this purpose. In such cases, the retouch module offers two further options:\nfill tool Fill the drawn region with a selected color. blur tool Apply a blur to the drawn region, smoothing out any details. These two options are most useful when used together with wavelet decomposition, where they can be used to smooth over features within a selected detail layer.\n🔗wavelet decomposition Wavelets allow an image to be decomposed into a number of layers each containing varying levels of detail, so that you can work on each detail layer independently and then recombine them at the end. This is particularly useful in portrait photography, where you can deal with skin blotches and blemishes on a coarse layer of detail, leaving the finer skin texture untouched. The wavelets section provides more information on the decomposition process.\nThis method can be used with the healing tool, for example, to paint over a spot that appears in one of the coarse detail layers, while leaving the hairs in the fine detail layers intact:\nIt can also be used with the blur tool to even out coarse blotches in the skin, again without impacting the finer details (see the wavelets section for details on this technique).\n🔗module controls 🔗retouch tools The retouch tools section consists of two items:\nshapes The number after the shapes label indicates how many shapes have been placed on the image, either directly or within a wavelet layer. Click on one of the shape icons to draw a new shape on the image (see drawn masks for details).\nCtrl+click on a shape icon to draw multiple shapes continuously (right-click to cancel).\nClick the show and edit shapes button to show and edit any existing shapes for the currently-selected wavelet scale.\nalgorithms Choose a retouching algorithm (clone, heal, fill or blur). Ctrl+click to change the algorithm used for the currently-selected shape. Shift+click to set the default algorithm (used for new images or when you reset module parameters). 🔗wavelet decompose The wavelet decompose section centres around a bar graph that shows how the image has been decomposed into detail (scale) layers. The key features of the bar graph are:\nThe black square on the left represents the entire image before decomposition. The gray squares show the various wavelet detail layers, with fine details to the left, and coarse details to the right. The white square on the far right represents the residual image (the remainder of the image after the detail layers have been extracted). A light gray dot in a square indicates the currently-selected layer. Click on another square to select a different layer. The light gray bar running along the top indicates which levels of detail are visible at the current zoom level. Zoom in to see finer details. The triangle at the bottom shows how many layers the image has been decomposed into. Drag the triangle to the right to create more layers. Drag it to the left to decrease the number of layers. By default no wavelet decomposition is performed. The triangle at the top shows the current value of the \u0026ldquo;merge from\u0026rdquo; parameter (see below). The orange lines under the squares indicate which layers have retouch edits applied. The remaining items in this section are:\nscales Shows how many detail layers the image has been decomposed into. Zero indicates that no wavelet decomposition has been performed. current Shows which layer is currently selected (also marked with the light gray dot on the bar graph). merge from This setting allows a single edit to be applied to multiple consecutive scales within a group starting from the coarsest scale (excluding the residual image) down to the scale selected. For example, if \u0026ldquo;merge from\u0026rdquo; is set to 3 and the maximum scale is 5 then all edits that are added to scale 5 will be applied to scales 3, 4 and 5. Edits added to scale 4 will be applied to scales 3 and 4, and edits added to scale 3 will be applied to scale 3 only. If you set merge from to 0, then merging is disabled, and all edits apply only to the scale that they are defined in. Setting merge from to the highest scale available (in this example, 5) also disables merging. merge_from v 0 1 2 3 4 5 scale \u0026lt;-------o scale 5 edits \u0026lt;---o scale 4 edits o scale 3 edits o scale 2 edits o scale 1 edits display wavelet scale Display the currently-selected wavelet layer on the center image.

You can click to select or enter a custom rgb value or use the picker to take a sample from the image. brightness If the fill algorithm has been chosen for the currently-selected shape, fine-tune the color\u0026rsquo;s brightness. This slider also works in \u0026ldquo;erase\u0026rdquo; mode. blur type If the blur algorithm has been chosen for the currently-selected shape, choose whether to apply a \u0026ldquo;gaussian\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bilateral\u0026rdquo; blur. blur radius If the blur algorithm has been chosen for the currently-selected shape, choose the radius of the blur. mask opacity Alter the opacity of the mask associated with the currently-selected shape. An opacity of 1.0 indicates that the shape is completely opaque and the module\u0026rsquo;s effect is fully applied, whereas a value less than 1.0 indicates that the effect applied by the shape is blended with the underlying image to the degree indicated by the slider. 🔗panning and zooming the image While creating or editing a shape, mouse actions are applied to the current shape. If you need to move or zoom the portion of the image shown in the center view, hold down the \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; key while dragging the mouse or using the scroll wheel. While the key is held down, the mouse actions will apply to the entire image rather than the current shape.

The underlying mechanism is inspired by Markus Hebel\u0026rsquo;s ShiftN program. This module also allows for the rotation of the image to be adjusted.\nPerspective distortions are a natural effect when projecting a three dimensional scene onto a two dimensional plane and cause objects close to the viewer to appear larger than objects further away. Converging lines are a special case of perspective distortions frequently seen in architectural photographs \u0026ndash; parallel lines, when photographed at an angle, are transformed into converging lines that meet at some vantage point within or outside of the image frame.\nThis module is able to correct converging lines by warping the image in such a way that the lines in question become parallel to the image frame. Corrections can be applied in a vertical and horizontal direction, either separately or in combination. In order to perform automatic correction the module is able to analyze the image for suitable structural features consisting of line segments. You can also set the line structures manually by drawing a \u0026ldquo;perspective rectangle\u0026rdquo; or drawing multiple horizontal and vertical lines onto the image. Based on these (automatic or manually-drawn) line segments a fitting procedure is initiated, which determines the best values for the module\u0026rsquo;s parameters.\nAs the most common use case for this module is for rotation, the perspective correction controls are hidden by default.

This outlier elimination involves a statistical process using random sampling which means that each time you press the \u0026ldquo;get structure\u0026rdquo; button the color pattern of the lines will look slightly different.\nYou can manually change the status of line segments: Left-Click on a line to select it (turn the color to green or blue) and Right-click to deselect it (turn the color to red or yellow). If you keep the mouse button pressed, you can use a sweeping action to select/deselect multiple lines in a row. The size of the select/deselect brush can be changed with the mouse wheel. Hold down the Shift key and keep the left or right mouse button pressed while dragging to select or deselect all lines in the chosen rectangular area.\nOnce you are happy with the detected lines, select a \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; icon to complete the process.\n🔗fit Once you are happy with the identified horizontal and vertical lines, using one of the methods above, click on one of the \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; icons to automatically set the module\u0026rsquo;s parameters based on the defined structure. The image and the overlaid lines are then displayed with perspective corrections applied.\nYou may choose to automatically apply just the vertical corrections , just the horizontal corrections , or both together . Ctrl+click on any of the icons to apply a rotation without the lens shift. Shift+click on any of the icons to apply the lens shift without any rotation.\n🔗rotate Once you are happy with the applied perspective corrections, you may wish to perform a final rotation correction either by adjusting the rotation parameter or right-clicking and dragging the image to define a horizontal/vertical line.\n🔗module controls rotation Control the rotation of the image around its center to correct for a skewed horizon. To rotate by more than the default soft limit of ten degrees, right click and enter the desired value up to 180 degrees (see module controls). automatic cropping When activated, this feature crops the image to remove any black areas at the edges caused by the distortion correction. You can either crop to the \u0026ldquo;largest area\u0026rdquo;, or to the largest rectangle that maintains the original aspect ratio (\u0026ldquo;original format\u0026rdquo;). In the latter case you can manually adjust the automatic cropping result by clicking in the clip region and moving it around. The size of the region is modified automatically to exclude any black areas. lens shift (vertical) Correct converging vertical lines (i.e. to make the green lines parallel). In some cases you can obtain a more natural looking image if you correct vertical distortions to an 80 ~ 90% level rather than to the maximum extent. To do this, reduce the correction slider after having performed the automatic correction. lens shift (horizontal) Correct converging horizontal lines (i.e. to make the blue lines parallel). shear Shear the image along one of its diagonals. This is required when correcting vertical and horizontal perspective distortions simultaneously. lens model This parameter controls the lens focal length, camera crop factor and aspect ratio that used by the correction algorithm. If set to \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; a lens focal length of 28mm on a 35mm full-frame camera is assumed. If set to “specific”, the focal length and crop factor can be set manually using the sliders provided. focal length If the lens model is set to \u0026ldquo;specific\u0026rdquo;, set the lens focal length. The default value is taken from the image\u0026rsquo;s Exif data, and can be overridden by adjusting the slider manually. crop factor If the lens model is set to \u0026ldquo;specific\u0026rdquo;, set the camera crop factor. You will normally need to set this value manually. aspect adjust If the lens model is set to \u0026ldquo;specific\u0026rdquo;, this parameter allows for a free manual adjustment of the image\u0026rsquo;s aspect ratio. This is useful for \u0026ldquo;unsqueezing\u0026rdquo; images taken with an anamorphic lens (which changes the ratio of image height to width). structure Define horizontal and vertical lines in the image using a manual or automatic method (see workflow section for details). fit Set the distortion correction sliders automatically based on the identified structure (see workflow section for details). show guides Tick the box to show guide overlays whenever the module is activated. Click the icon on the right to control the properties of the guides.

You are advised to use the tone equalizer module instead.\n🔗module controls shadows Control the effect on shadows. Positive values will lighten shadows while negative values will darken them. highlights Control the effect on highlights. Positive values will lighten highlights while negative values will darken them. white point adjustment By default the algorithm of this module leaves the black and white points untouched. In some cases an image might contain tonal variations beyond the white point, i.e. above a luminance value of 100. A negative shift in the white point adjustment can bring these values back into the proper range so that further details in the highlights become visible. soften with The underlying blurring filter: gaussian or bilateral. Try the bilateral filter if the gaussian blur generates halos. radius The radius of the blurring filter used by the algorithm. Higher values give softer transitions between shadows and highlights but might introduce halos. Lower values will reduce the size of halos but may lead to an artificial look. The bilateral filter is much less prone to halo artifacts. compress Control how strongly the effect extends to the mid-tones. High values limit the effect to only the extreme shadows and highlights. Lower values also cause adjustments to the mid-tones. At 100% this module has no visible effect as only absolute black and absolute white are affected. shadows color adjustment Control the color saturation adjustment made to shadows. High values cause saturation enhancements on lightened shadows. Low values cause desaturation on lightened shadows. It is normally safe to leave this at its default of 100%.

Most data created within darktable (metadata, tags, and image processing steps) is stored in separate .XMP sidecar files. These files are stored alongside the original Raw files and allow darktable to store information about the images as well as the full editing history without touching the original raw files. When you import an image into darktable for the first time, an XMP file is automatically generated. The generation of XMP files can be disabled in preferences \u0026gt; storage \u0026gt; XMP sidecar files but this is not recommended in normal use.\nNote: custom sort sequence numbers are not stored in sidecar files. This could be destructive if imported into another darktable image library \u0026ndash; including their orginal library \u0026ndash; after import, duplication, or image resequencing.\nFor a given source image, multiple editing versions, called duplicates, can co-exist, sharing the same input image data but each having their own metadata, tags and processing steps. Each duplicate of a given image (named \u0026lt;basename\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;extension) is represented by a separate XMP sidecar file (with a filename constructed in the form \u0026lt;basename\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;number\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;extension\u0026gt;.xmp, where \u0026lt;number\u0026gt; represents the version number of that edit).

The version number of each duplicate is displayed in the image information module in each of darktable\u0026rsquo;s views.\nYour work is automatically synchronised to the sidecar files without the need to press a “save” button. When backing up your data, make sure that you also retain copies of the XMP files, as these are required to fully reconstruct your work in case of a disaster.\nIn addition to the sidecar files, darktable keeps all image-related data in its library database for fast access. An image can only be viewed and edited from within darktable if its data has first been loaded into the library database. This happens automatically when you first import an image. If an image is subsequently re-imported, the database will be updated from the contents of its XMP file.\nOnce an image has been imported into darktable, the database entries take precedence over the XMP file. Subsequent changes to the XMP file by any other software are not visible to darktable \u0026ndash; such changes will be overwritten the next time darktable synchronizes the file. On request, darktable can be configured to search for updated XMP files at startup, offering a choice to update the database or overwrite the XMP file where changes are identified.

Before using sigmoid, you should first use the exposure module to adjust the mid-tones to your liking. less is more You should try to accomplish the majority of your processing using modules in the scene-referred section of the pixelpipe and not rely on the display transform module (sigmoid, filmic rgb, base curve) to do all the work. preserve hue to taste This module provides a number of methods to preserve hues. You are advised to use the \u0026ldquo;per channel\u0026rdquo; mode and tune the hue preservation to your liking on a per-image basis. Sunsets and fire are two examples where users commonly reduce the hue preservation to achieve a \u0026ldquo;hotter\u0026rdquo; look. keep skew at bay For images like portraits, it is best to refrain from using skew values above zero. This way you will avoid harsh transitions in the skin tones. This is particularly important when hue preservation is not enabled, as the skew also affects the hue path of the skin tones. 🔗module controls contrast Adjust the aggressiveness of the compression while leaving middle-gray unchanged. Higher values require lower exposure to reach display white, and shadows become darker. Lower contrast is able to display a larger dynamic range. skew Lean the compression towards shadows or highlights. Skew can be used to transfer some contrast from shadows to highlights or vice versa without changing the amount of contrast at middle gray. Positive skew flattens shadows and compresses highlights. Negative skew creates darker shadows and duller highlights. color processing The mode used to map pixel values from scene to display space. per channel mode applies the sigmoid curve to each rgb channel separately, affecting luminance, chroma, and hue. Hue can be optionally preserved using the preserve hue option (below). This mode is in line with the behavior of the color layers in analog film, and handles smooth roll-off to bright areas very well. rgb ratio is similar to preserve color in filmic rgb. It maps the rgb triplet uniformly using the sigmoid curve, which preserves the spectral color of the pixel. Bright colorful pixels are desaturated along spectral lines as they would otherwise end up outside the display gamut. preserve hue (per channel mode only) Choose how much to preserve hue \u0026ndash; 100% preserves the spectral hue of the image (identical to using the \u0026ldquo;rgb ratio\u0026rdquo; color processing mode); 0% uses the per-channel mode with heavy hue skewing (see below). An acceptable approximation of preserved perceptual hue is usually somewhere between the two extremes. All colors that lie between the primary colors (red, green, and blue) converge towards the closest secondary colors (yellow, magenta, and cyan). The per channel hue skew effect creates yellow sunsets and fires, magenta-looking blue lights, and cyan skies. The skew is stronger for brighter and more saturated pixels. target black Lower bound that the sigmoid curve converges to as the scene value approaches zero \u0026ndash; this should normally be left unchanged. You can use this to give a faded analog look, but should instead prefer to use the \u0026ldquo;global offset\u0026rdquo; slider in color balance rgb to achieve a similar effect. target white Upper bound that the sigmoid curve converges to as the scene value approaches infinity \u0026ndash; this should normally be left unchanged. You can use this to clip white at a defined scene intensity. 🔗primaries Expand this section to set custom primaries. You are advised to use the \u0026ldquo;smooth\u0026rdquo; preset as a starting point and then adjust using the following controls:\nNote: These settings apply only to the per channel processing mode.\nbase primaries Choose the set of primaries to use as the base for adjustments. This is a bit like locally overriding the working profile, and is necessary to allow presets to be created that don\u0026rsquo;t change even if the user amends the working profile used in the pixel pipeline. red/green/blue attenuation Attenuate (decrease) the purity of the red, green or blue primaries before the signal is processed through sigmoid\u0026rsquo;s per-channel curves. An important consequence is that now even the brightest and most pure inputs get smoothly degraded to achromatic at the high end. This avoids posterization and flat-looking patches, which are often seen with, for example, blue LED lights. red/green/blue rotation Rotate the primaries where the per-channel curves are applied. This affects the hue paths when approaching white in the high end. These controls should not normally need large adjustments from the starting values given in the \u0026ldquo;smooth\u0026rdquo; preset. recover purity Recover some of the original purity. A value of 100 causes all of the attenuations to be restored after the per-channel process is done. This lands the middle range values near their original purities. A value of 0 doesn’t restore the purity at all, so the more you apply attenuation, the less purity there is in the final image. The rotations are always restored regardless of the value of this slider. When this slider is at 0, the output of the module is guaranteed to remain within the gamut footprint of the chosen base primaries. Bear in mind that unlike the rgb primaries module, this is not a tool for creative color grading but rather a set of controls to provide a reasonable starting point for further edits. The effect of these adjustments is not the same as the rgb primaries module even though the interface looks similar.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/sigmoid/","tags":null,"title":"sigmoid"},{"categories":null,"content":"Create a softened image using the Orton effect.\nMichael Orton achieved his results on slide film by using two exposures of the same scene, one well exposed and one overexposed.

In order to process a raw image a number of such modules act on the input image in sequence, each performing a different operation on the image data. For those familiar with Adobe Photoshop, the concept of a processing module in darktable is analogous to that of an adjustment layer in that both make an incremental adjustment to the image, building on top of the adjustments that came before.\nUtility modules are also provided by darktable, however these are not directly involved in image processing, instead providing a GUI that allows you to manage your images, tag them, export them etc.\nEvery processing module acts independently of the others, but all modules perform their processing in a similar manner:\nReceive the module input from the last executed module and perform an operation on it to produce the processed output. This operation is different for every processing module.\nCombine the module input and processed output using a blending operator to produce the blended output. If no blending is performed, the output of this step is the same as the processed output.\nGenerate a mask, which defines an opacity for each pixel in the image. The opacity is later used to control how strongly the module\u0026rsquo;s operation is applied to each part of the image.\nYou may define your own mask by drawing shapes over the image or by using pixel properties from the module input or processed output (see masks for details). This mask may be further modified with a global opacity setting, which affects every pixel equally.\nIf no drawn/parametric mask is used, the output of this step is a mask where every pixel has the same opacity (governed by the global opacity setting). If no opacity is defined (no blending is performed) a global opacity of 1.0 (or 100%) is assumed.\nCombine the module input and blended output pixel-by-pixel using the mask as a mixing operator, to produce the final output. Where the mask opacity is 100%, the final output is the blended output for that pixel. Where the mask opacity is 0 the final output is the module input for that pixel. An intermediate opacity combines the blended output and module input proportionally. The final output is passed to the next module for further processing.\nSteps 2 and 3 are optional and not supported by all modules. For example, the demosaic module must be applied to the entire raw file in order to produce a legible image so it does not make sense to mask or blend its output.\nEach of the above steps is defined in more detail in subsequent sections.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/the-anatomy-of-a-module/","tags":null,"title":"the anatomy of a processing module"},{"categories":null,"content":"Processing high resolution images is a demanding task requiring a modern computer. In terms of both memory and CPU power, getting the best out of a typical 15, 20 or 25 megapixel image can quickly take your computer to its limits.\ndarktable\u0026rsquo;s requirements are no exception. All calculations are performed on 4 x 32bit floating point numbers. This is slower than “ordinary” 8 or 16 bit integer algebra, but eliminates all problems of tonal breaks or loss of information.\nA great deal of optimization has been undertaken to make darktable as fast as possible. If you run a current version of darktable on a modern computer, you might not notice any “slowness”. However, there are conditions and certain modules where you will feel (or hear from the howling of your CPU fan) how much your poor multi-core processor has to struggle.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where OpenCL comes in. OpenCL allows darktable to take advantage of the enormous power of modern graphics cards. Gamers\u0026rsquo; demand for highly detailed 3D worlds in modern shooters (as well as cryptocurrency mining) has fostered rapid GPU development. AMD, NVIDIA and Co had to put enormous processing power into their GPUs to meet these demands. The result is modern graphics cards with highly parallelized GPUs that can quickly calculate surfaces and textures at high frame rates.\nYou are not a gamer and you don\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of that power? Well, then you should at least use it in darktable! For the task of highly parallel floating point calculations modern GPUs are much faster than CPUs. This is especially true when you want to repeat the same few processing steps millions of times. Typical use case: processing high megapixel images.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/special-topics/opencl/background/","tags":null,"title":"the background"},{"categories":null,"content":"A classic digital photography tool to alter the tones of an image\u0026rsquo;s using curves.\nThis module is very similar to the rgb curve module but works in Lab color space.\nActivate the picker to show the picked values on the displayed histogram. Numerical (Lab) values of the input and output (see below) at the selected spot or area are shown at the top left of the graph.\n🔗module controls Please refer to the curves section for more details about how to modify curves including the interpolation method, scale for graph and preserve colors controls.\ncolor spaces Depending on the desired intent, the tone curve can be applied in one of three color spaces: Lab (linked or separated channels): Lab is a perceptual color space that is designed to approximate the way humans perceive colors and lightness. It represents color information independently of lightness. In “Lab, separated channels” mode, you are given fully independent control over the luminance (L-channel) and the chrominance (a/b-channels). In “Lab, linked channels” mode, only the luminance (L-channel) control is available. The color saturation correction is automatically computed, for each pixel, from the contrast correction applied to the luminance channel. This works better in cases where a subtle contrast correction is applied, but gives increasingly inaccurate saturation correction as the contrast is more dramatically altered. XYZ (linked channels): XYZ is a linear technical color space designed to link the physiological light response of the human eye to RGB color spaces. As with Lab, it separates lightness from color information, but does so in a way that does not account for the role of the brain\u0026rsquo;s correction in human perception. The “XYZ, linked channels” mode offers an alternative to “Lab, linked channels”, and works by applying the L-channel curve to all three channels in the XYZ color space. Look at blend mode “coloradjustment” if you want to tune the strength of automatic chroma scaling. This mode is known to produce a slight hue shift towards yellow. RGB (linked channels): RGB is a linear color space designed to capture and display images in additive synthesis. It is related to capture and display media and does not isolate color and lightness information. The “RGB, linked channels” mode works in ProPhoto RGB and applies the L-channel curve to all three channels in the RGB color space. Adding contrast in RGB space is known to desaturate highlights and boost saturation in the shadows, but this has proven to be the most reliable way to edit contrast, and is the standard method used in most software. This mode makes the tone curve module behave in much the same way as the base-curve module, except that the latter works in camera RGB space. Note that the module works in Lab color space in all cases. This means that the middle-gray coordinate is always 50% in the graph, no matter what color space is used. The same applies to the inset histogram displayed in the background of the curve. The controls are converted to the relevant color space before the corrections are applied \u0026ndash; in RGB and XYZ, the middle-gray is therefore remapped from 50% to 18%.\nL-channel curve The tone curve in L-channel works on Lightness. To provide a better overview, a lightness histogram is displayed in the module. When working in one of the \u0026ldquo;linked channels\u0026rdquo; modes, the L-channel curve is the only one available. The horizontal axis represents the lightness of the input image pixels. The vertical axis represents the lightness of the output image pixels. The default straight diagonal line does not change anything. A curve above the default diagonal increases the lightness, whereas a curve below decreases it. An S-like curve will enhance the contrast of the image. You can move the end-points of the default diagonal to change the black and white points and hence alter the overall contrast \u0026ndash; this has the same effect as changing the black and white points in the levels module.\na/b-channel curves The curves in the a and b channels work on color values and are available only in the “Lab, separated channels” mode. The horizontal axis represents the color channel value of the input image pixels. The vertical axis represents the color channel value of the output image pixels. Positive a-values correspond to more magenta colors; negative a-values correspond to more greenish colors. Positive b-values correspond to more yellowish colors; negative b-values correspond to more blueish colors. The default diagonal straight line does not change anything. Shifting the center of the curve will give the image a color tint: shifting the a-channel upwards gives a magenta tint; shifting the b-channel upwards gives a yellow tint; shifting the a-channel downwards gives a green tint; shifting the b-channel downwards gives a blue tint.\nIncreasing/decreasing the steepness of a curve, without shifting its center, will increase/decrease the color saturation of the respective channel. With properly defined curves you can exert fine control on color saturation, depending on the input pixel\u0026rsquo;s colors.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/tone-curve/","tags":null,"title":"tone curve"},{"categories":null,"content":"Dodge and burn while preserving local contrast.\nThe tone equalizer module replaces the need for other tone-mapping modules such as the shadows and highlights, tone curve, zone system (deprecated), and similar modules. It works in linear RGB space and utilizes a user-defined mask to guide the dodging and burning adjustments, helping to preserve local contrast within the image.\nThe following diagram describes how the tone equalizer works:\nCreate a monochrome guided mask that divides the input image into regions of similar luminosity. The resulting mask should blur the fine details within the image so that pixels within each region are all treated similarly, preserving local contrast.\nAdjust the sliders in the simple tab or the equalizer graph in the advanced tab to alter the brightness of the underlying image, based on the brightness of the mask. Exposure can also be adjusted by scrolling with the mouse while hovering the cursor over the preview image (see cursor indicator/control for details).\nIn the simple tab, each slider corresponds to a single brightness zone (EV) in the mask, which can be raised or lowered to adjust the exposure of the image where the mask\u0026rsquo;s brightness lies in that zone. Similarly, in the equalizer tab, the horizontal axis of the graph corresponds to the brightness level of the mask, and the vertical axis specifies the required exposure adjustment to pixels where the mask matches that brightness level.\nThe exposure of each pixel of the input image is adjusted using the mask and the equalizer graph. For each pixel, the module looks up the brightness of the mask at that point, finds the matching brightness on the horizontal axis of the equalizer graph, and increases or decreases the exposure accordingly (using the vertical axis of the graph).\nIt is important that the mask separates the image into regions of similar brightness, and that a suitable amount of blur is applied within those regions. This means that all of the pixels in each region will have their exposure adjusted similarly, without adversely affecting local contrast. Examine your image beforehand to identify which regions you wish to dodge and burn, and use the controls on the masking tab to ensure that those areas are reasonably separated in tone within the final mask. This will allow those regions to be adjusted independently.\n🔗module controls The controls of the tone equalizer module are divided between three tabs.\ndisplay exposure mask Click on the icon to the right of this label to show/hide the module\u0026rsquo;s guided mask over the top of the image. This control is available in all three tabs. 🔗simple tab This tab splits the brightness of the guided mask into nine zones (from \u0026ndash;8 to 0 EV) and allows you to alter each zone independently. This is a simplified interface and is used to generate the same tone adjustment curve as shown in the advanced tab.\n\u0026ndash;8 EV \u0026hellip; 0 EV Each slider adjusts the exposure of all pixels where the guided mask has the given brightness. If the mask\u0026rsquo;s histogram is evenly spread over the entire tonal range, sliders towards the top generally affect the shadows, whereas sliders towards the bottom generally affect the highlights. You can check the spread of the histogram within the advanced tab. 🔗advanced tab This tab allows you to control the same intensity levels as in the simple tab, though here they are represented as control points on a curve. Behind the curve is a histogram representing the intensity levels of the guided mask (not the underlying image). If the histogram is too bunched up, this means your mask doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a good spread of intensity levels, which makes it harder to independently control the brightness of the different parts of your image. It is therefore recommended that the histogram be adjusted so that it extends the entire range, covering as many control points as possible for maximum flexibility. You can adjust the mask using the controls in the masking tab.\nClick+drag the control points on the curve to adjust the brightness of all pixels where the mask has the given intensity. If the mask\u0026rsquo;s histogram is evenly spread over the entire tonal range, control points to the left will generally affect the shadows, and control points to the right will generally affect the highlights. Moving a single control point will also affect control points on either side to ensure the curve remains smooth. This behaviour can be adjusted using the curve smoothing control.\ncurve smoothing Control how the curve is interpolated between control points. Move the slider to the right to make the transitions between the control points more gradual, but beware that going past about 0.6 can introduce some instability (oscillations) in the curve due to mathematical constraints. Move the slider to the left for a more well-behaved curve, but beware that this can result in harsher tonal transitions that may damage local contrast. mask exposure compensation Adjust the mask\u0026rsquo;s histogram to the left or right. If you have used the exposure module to adjust the image brightness, you may need to offset that adjustment by using this slider to re-centre the mask\u0026rsquo;s histogram. Click on the wand icon to the right of the slider to set the exposure compensation such that the average of the mask\u0026rsquo;s histogram will coincide with the central \u0026ndash;4EV control point. The slider can then be fine-tuned as required. mask contrast compensation Dilate (spread out) or compress the mask\u0026rsquo;s histogram. The wand icon to the right of the slider will propose a reasonable starting point, which can then be fine-tuned to optimize the spread of the histogram under the tone equalizer control points. 🔗masking tab This tab contains controls for adjusting the guided mask.\nThe purpose of the guided mask is to separate out areas with different tonal ranges so that they can be independently brightened or darkened by the tone equalizer. The masking filters are designed to allow sharp edges between these areas to be preserved, while blurring details within a given tonal range, so that the brightness can be adjusted without adversely impacting local contrast. Ideally the mask histogram shown in the advanced tab should be spread out across all of the control points.\nWhen setting up the guided mask you will need to strike a balance between obtaining a smooth blur within tonal regions (to preserve local contrast) and preservation of the boundaries between those regions. Some experimentation will be required to find the best settings. Often the key controls to adjust are the exposure/contrast compensation sliders at the bottom of the module.\nDisplaying the guided mask while making these adjustments will help you to understand these controls and better judge the quality of the mask.\nluminance estimator Choose the method by which the luminance of a pixel will be estimated when mapping it to a mask intensity value (default RGB euclidean norm). preserve details Choose the smoothing algorithm used to blur the mask: no: Do not smooth the mask (the effect is the same as using normal tone curves). When the module is used to compress dynamic range, this option can cause compression of local contrast. This can be useful when increasing (local and global) contrast. guided filter: Use the original guided filter algorithm to blur the mask while attempting to preserve edges. One of the limitations of this algorithm is that the guided filter is exposure-sensitive, meaning that shadows tend to be blurred more than highlights. Note that this limitation can sometimes be an asset: if one wants to lighten shadows a lot, the guided filter can provide very good local contrast preservation. average guided filter: Use this option in cases where the effect of the guided filter is too strong. In this mode, a geometric mean is taken between the output of the original guided filter algorithm and the output given by the no option. eigf (default): The exposure-independent guided filter solves the problem of the original guided filter, in that it makes the degree of blurring independent of the exposure. This means the degree of blurring applied to the highlights and the shadows regions should be about the same. This improved algorithm is now the default option. averaged eigf: This option takes the geometric mean between the eigf mask and the mask generated by the no option, and is useful in cases where the degree of blurring in the mask needs to be mitigated. filter diffusion By default this is set to a value of 1, meaning that the filtering algorithm is run once on the input image to produce the blurred monochrome mask. If you increase this to 2, the filtering algorithm will be run once on the input image to produce an intermediate mask, and then a second time on the intermediate mask. As a result, the final mask will be more blurred than when using a single iteration. Progressively higher values will diffuse the mask even further. However, because the mask filtering algorithm is run multiple times, each iteration will increase the processing time.\nsmoothing diameter This controls how much of the surrounding image to take into account when calculating the mask\u0026rsquo;s blur at a particular point, defined as a percentage of the length of the image\u0026rsquo;s longer side (default 5%). With lower values, the transition between darker and lighter areas of the mask will be more pronounced. As the value is increased, transitions become smoother/softer. For the default exposure-independent guided filter (eigf), you should typically use blurring radii around 1-10%. With the original guided filter, blurring radii around 1-25% will typically yield better results. edges refinement/feathering Higher values force the mask to follow high contrast edges more closely. Lower values give smoother gradients, but may introduce halos. If required, feathering can be set to values as high as 10,000. mask quantization Apply a degree of posterization to the mask, so that it tends to centre round a few discrete levels. In some cases, this may be useful to help separate out areas of your image into distinct masking levels. 🔗cursor indicator/control When the tone equalizer module is enabled and expanded, you can move the mouse pointer over the preview image to show a cursor that displays information about the pixel under the pointer. When this cursor is shown, the mouse wheel can be used to brighten or darken the areas of your image that match the mask intensity level at that point. This provides a convenient way to quickly brighten or darken specific parts of the image.\nthe cross-hairs indicate the position of the pixel under the cursor the text label shows the intensity of the guided mask at that point, in EV the shade of the outer circle indicates the intensity of the mask at that point if the tone equalizer has brightened or darkened pixels matching this mask intensity, the magnitude of the adjustment is indicated by an arc on the left-hand-side. The longer the arc, the greater the brightness adjustment, if there has been an exposure adjustment, the shade of the inner circle indicates the amount of brightening or darkening, relative to the mask\u0026rsquo;s intensity at that point (as indicated by the outer gray circle). That is to say, if the pixel under the crosshairs has been brightened, the inner circle will be a lighter shade of gray than the outer circle; if the pixel has been darkened, the inner circle will be a darker shade of gray than the outer circle. If you need to move or zoom the portion of the image shown in the center view while the module is expanded, hold down the \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; key while dragging the mouse or using the scroll wheel. As long as the key is held down, mouse actions adjust the viewport rather than adjusting the tone curve.\n🔗presets The tone equalizer comes with several presets that can use used to compress shadows and highlights. Each comes in two variants, using either the guided filter (gf) or the exposure-independent guided filter (eigf). The variants using the guided filter tend to preserve local contrast in the shadows better those that use the exposure-independent guided filter, but at the price of reducing the local contrast in the highlights. Either of these variants may lead to better results, depending on the image. In both cases, the presets preserve middle-gray, so you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to adjust the global exposure after activating the tone equalizer.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/tone-equalizer/","tags":null,"title":"tone equalizer"},{"categories":null,"content":"Add a correction curve to image data.

Editing white balance using temperature and tint on an image previously edited using channel coefficients may therefore give odd results, at least where high temperature values are involved.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/white-balance/","tags":null,"title":"white balance"},{"categories":null,"content":" Please note that this module is deprecated from darktable 3.6 and should no longer be used for new edits. Please use the quick access panel instead.\nA convenience module that combines controls from exposure, highlight reconstruction, color balance and vibrance into a single module.\nWhile this module can provide a quick and convenient way to make simple adjustments to an image, it must be used with care. Normally exposure adjustments should come before input color profile in the pixelpipe, and color adjustments should come after. Because the basic adjustments module combines all of these functions into a single operation in the pixelpipe, it may not play nicely with other modules. Therefore, if you plan to use basic adjustments with other modules, please instead consider using the exposure + base curve / tone curve / filmic rgb + color balance modules so that these operations occur in the correct places in the pixelpipe.\n🔗module controls black level correction Equivalent to black level correction in the exposure module, this slider defines the threshold at which dark gray values are cut off to pure black. Reducing this can bring some dark colors back into gamut. Increasing this slider may appear to increase the contrast and pop of an image, but it can push dark colors out of gamut, and clipped data cannot be recovered further down the pixel pipe. To control the contrast in the shadows, it is better to use other modules such as tone curve or levels, which mitigate these negative impacts further down the pixel pipeline. exposure Adjust exposure compensation. Adding 1 EV of exposure compensation is equivalent to doubling the exposure time in camera, opening the aperture by 1 stop, or doubling the ISO. Positive exposure corrections will make the image brighter. As a side effect noise level is increased. Depending on the basic noise level of your camera and the ISO value of your image, positive exposure compensations with up to 1EV or 2EV should still give reasonable results.\nNegative exposure corrections will make the image darker. Given the nature of digital images this can not correct for fully blown out highlights but allows you to reconstruct data if only some of the RGB channels are clipped (see the highlight reconstruction module for information on how to deal with clipped pixels).\nhighlight compression Compress the highlights of the image in order to recover detail. contrast Equivalent to the contrast slider in the color balance module, this is used to increase the separation of luminance values around a fulcrum point, in effect making the tone curve steeper. The middle gray slider sets the fulcrum point for the contrast, and any pixels whose luminance matches this middle gray point will be unaffected. Pixels brighter than the middle gray point will become even brighter, and pixels darker than the middle gray point will become even darker. preserve colors If a non-linear tone curve is applied to each of the RGB channels individually, then the amount of tone adjustment applied to each color channel may be different, and this can cause hue shifts. Therefore, the preserve colors menu provides different methods of calculating the \u0026ldquo;luminance level\u0026rdquo; of a pixel. The amount of tone adjustment is calculated based on this luminance value, and then this same adjustment is applied to all three of the RGB channels. Different luminance estimators can affect the contrast in different parts of the image, depending on the specific characteristics of that image. The user can therefore choose a particular estimator that provides the best results for the given image. middle gray Set the fulcrum point for the contrast slider. This is equivalent to the contrast fulcrum slider on the color balance module. If the contrast slider is set to 0 this slider will not have any effect. brightness Equivalent to increasing the gamma factor slider in the color balance module. Moving the slider to the right will increase the brightness of the image, with an emphasis on the mid-tones. saturation Equivalent to the output saturation slider on the color balance module, this slider affects the saturation, or brilliance and intensity of the colors. Moving the slider to the right will increase the amount of color in the image; moving the slider to the left will reduce the amount of color in the image. vibrance Accentuate the colors of the image without adding unnatural colors, as it\u0026rsquo;s often the case with the saturation slider. It works by reducing the lightness of already saturated pixels to make the colors more vivid. You can also achieve some interesting effects by combining it with the saturation slider to target more or less saturated areas of the image. auto Automatically adjust the exposure, taking into account the entire image, or use the picker to select a rectangular area of the image \u0026ndash; the exposure will be automatically adjusted based on the selected region. This allows you to prioritise which parts of the image should be well-exposed. clip This affects the number of pixels that will be clipped to black or white during the auto-exposure calculation. Moving this slider to the right will allow more pixels to be clipped and increase the contrast; moving this slider to the left will compress the image more and lower the contrast.

Please use the color calibration module instead.\nA simple yet powerful tool to manage color channels.\nThis module accepts red, green and blue channels as an input and provides red, green, blue, gray, hue, saturation and lightness channels as output. It allows you to independently control how much each input channel contributes to each output channel.\n🔗RGB matrix multiplication You can think of the channel mixer as a type of matrix multiplication between a 3x3 matrix and the input [R G B] values.\n┌ R_out ┐ ┌ Rr Rg Rb ┐ ┌ R_in ┐ │ G_out │ = │ Gr Gg Gb │ X │ G_in │ └ B_out ┘ └ Br Bg Bb ┘ └ B_in ┘ If, for example, you\u0026rsquo;ve been provided with a matrix to transform from one color space to another, you can enter the matrix coefficients into the channel mixer as follows:\nset the destination to red then set the Rr, Rg \u0026amp; Rb values using the red, green and blue sliders set the destination to green then set the Gr, Gg \u0026amp; Gb values using the red, green and blue sliders set the destination to blue then set the Br, Bg \u0026amp; Bb values using the red, green and blue sliders By default, channel mixer just copies the input [R G B] channels straight over to the matching output channels. This is equivalent to multiplying by the identity matrix:\n┌ R_out ┐ ┌ 1 0 0 ┐ ┌ R_in ┐ │ G_out │ = │ 0 1 0 │ X │ G_in │ └ B_out ┘ └ 0 0 1 ┘ └ B_in ┘ As an example use case, the following matrix is useful for taming ugly out-of-gamut blue LED lights by making them more magenta:\n┌ 1.00 -0.18 0.18 ┐ │ -0.20 1.00 0.20 │ └ 0.05 -0.05 1.00 ┘ In this case it is useful to use a parametric mask to limit the effect of the channel mixer to just the problematic colors.\nA more intuitive take for what the channel mixer sliders do:\nfor the red destination, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more red. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more cyan. for the green destination, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more green. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more magenta. for the blue destination, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more blue. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more yellow. 🔗monochrome Another very useful application of the channel mixer is the ability to mix the channels together to produce a grayscale output \u0026ndash; a monochrome image. Use the gray destination, and set the red, green and blue sliders to control how much each channel contributes to the brightness of the output. This is equivalent to the following matrix multiplication:\nGRAY_out = [ r g b ] X ┌ R_in ┐ │ G_in │ └ B_in ┘ When dealing with skin tones, the relative weights of the three channels will affect the level of detail in the image. Placing more weight on red (e.g. [0.9, 0.3, -0.3]) will make for smooth skin tones, whereas emphasising green (e.g. [0.4, 0.75, -0.15]) will bring out more detail. In both cases the blue channel is reduced to avoid emphasising unwanted skin texture.\nDifferent types of traditional black and white film have differing sensitivities to red, green and blue colors, and this can be simulated by setting the gray destination coefficients appropriately. The channel mixer module has a number of built-in presets that can be used to achieve this.\n🔗module controls destination Select the destination channel that will be affected by the slider settings immediately below. The red, green and blue destination channels are used for color mixing as described in the matrix multiplication section above. The gray channel is used for making grayscale images as described in the monochrome section above. It is also possible to define the R, G \u0026amp; B input channels to produce HSL (hue, saturation and lightness) values on the output, although this is a very specialised application. red Defines how much the red input channel should contribute to the selected destination channel. green Defines how much the green input channel should contribute to the selected destination channel. blue Defines how much the blue input channel should contribute to the selected destination channel.

For best sharpness results set “lanczos3” as the pixel interpolator in preferences \u0026gt; processing.\n🔗module controls The crop and rotate module controls are split between two tabs as follows:\n🔗main tab flip Flip the image on the horizontal, vertical or both axes. angle Correct the rotation angle to level an image by setting a numerical value in degrees or using the mouse. To use the mouse, right-click and drag to draw a line along a suitable horizontal or vertical feature. As soon as you release the mouse button the image is rotated so that the line you drew matches the horizontal or vertical axis. keystone Correct perspective distortions. This tool is useful, for example, when you shoot a high building from the ground with a short focal length, aiming upwards with your camera. The combobox allows you to select the type of correction you want to use: vertical: Limit the correction to vertical lines horizontal: Limit the correction to horizontal lines full: Correct horizontal and vertical lines at the same time Depending on the selected correction type you will see two or four straight adjustment lines overlaid on your image. Two red circles on each line allow you to modify the line positions with your mouse. Each line additionally carries a “symmetry” button. If activated (and highlighted in red) all movements of the affected line will be mirrored by the opposite line.\nIn order to correct perspective distortions, you need to find suitable horizontal and/or vertical features in your image and align the adjustment lines with them. When finished, press the “OK” button located close to the center of the image \u0026ndash; corrections will be applied immediately. You can return to the module and refine your corrections by selecting “correction applied” in the keystone combobox.\nautomatic cropping Automatically crop the image to avoid black edges on the image borders. This is useful when rotating the image. aspect Set the aspect ratio of the crop, constraining the width:height ratio of the crop rectangle to the chosen aspect. Many common numerical ratios are pre-defined. A few special aspect ratios deserve explanation: freehand: Crop without any restrictions original image: Retain the aspect ratio of the original image square: Constrains the aspect ratio to be 1:1 golden cut: The golden ratio (1.62:1) You can also enter any other ratio after opening the combobox by typing it in the form of “x:y” or as a decimal (e.g. \u0026ldquo;0.5\u0026rdquo; to apply a ratio of 2:1).\nIf you want to add an aspect ratio to the pre-defined drop-down list you can do this by including a line of the form \u0026ldquo;plugins/darkroom/clipping/extra_aspect_ratios/foo=x:y\u0026rdquo; in darktable\u0026rsquo;s configuration file $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc. Here “foo” defines the name of the new aspect ratio and “x” and “y” the corresponding numerical values (x and y must be integers). Note that you can only add new entries for ratios not already present in the drop-down list.\nFinally, the button beside the aspect combobox allows you to switch between portrait and landscape orientation if you have selected a rectangular aspect ratio.\nNote: When resizing an image in freehand mode you may retain the currently-set aspect ratio by holding Shift while dragging on any of the resize controls.\nshow guides Tick the box to show guide overlays whenever the module is activated.

Because scene-referred is not subject to these restrictions, this fulcrum needs to be explicitly defined by the user when performing blending operations in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space. The additional blend fulcrum parameter will be presented to the user when using one of these blend modes in this color space. The effect depends on the operator used. For example, values above the fulcrum might be brightened and values below darkened, or vice versa.\nThe final output of a module is computed \u0026lsquo;per-pixel\u0026rsquo; as follows:\nfinal_output = (1.0 - opacity) * module_input + opacity * blended_output where the blended_output is a combination of the input and output images, depending on the blend mode (below), and the opacity is defined \u0026lsquo;per-pixel\u0026rsquo; by a combination of the mask and global opacity parameter.

In \u0026ldquo;reversed\u0026rdquo; blend modes, an opacity of 0% outputs an image that is identical to the output image of the module.\n🔗normal modes normal The most commonly used blend mode, \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; simply mixes input and output to an extent determined by the opacity parameter. This mode is commonly used to reduce the strength of a module\u0026rsquo;s effect by reducing the opacity. This is also usually the blend mode of choice when applying a module\u0026rsquo;s effect selectively with masks. This mode is also known as the \u0026ldquo;over\u0026rdquo; Porter-Duff alpha blending operator (see alpha compositing for more details). normal bounded not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space This blend mode is the same as “normal”, except that the input and output data are clamped to a particular min/max value range. Out-of-range values are effectively blocked and are not passed to subsequent modules. Sometimes this helps to prevent artifacts. However, in most cases (e.g. highly color-saturated extreme highlights) it is better to let unbound values travel through the pixelpipe to be properly handled later. The “normal” blend mode is therefore usually preferred. 🔗arithmetic modes addition Add together the pixel values of the input and output images, lightening the output. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, the pixel values of the output image are multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. subtract Subtract the pixel value of the output from the input. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, the pixel values of the output image are multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. Pixel values less than 0 are set to 0. multiply Multiply the pixel values of the input and output together. When blending in display-referred color spaces, pixel values are between 0 and 1.0, the final output will be clamped and will always be darker. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, this value is further multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. In this case, values may be greater than 1.0 and therefore brighten the base image. This may have other side-effects, such as updating the white point in the filmic module. Multiply blending simulates an optical variable density filter, where the density is defined by the output of the module. It has many applications, from blooming and local contrast enhancements (when used with a blur or low-pass filter) to dodging/burning and global contrast enhancements (when used with exposure). The fulcrum sets the output intensity threshold between darkening and brightening (any RGB value below fulcrum will darken).\ndivide Divide the pixel values of the input by the output. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, the pixel values of the output image are multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. Since this is the inverse of the multiply mode, it will darken where multiply brightens and vice versa. Everything else works in essentially the same way.\nscreen not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space Invert the input and output pixel values, multiply those values together and invert the result. This yields approximately the opposite effect to \u0026ldquo;multiply\u0026rdquo; mode \u0026ndash; the resulting image is usually brighter, and sometimes “washed out” in appearance. average Return the arithmetic mean of the input and output pixel values. difference Return the absolute difference between the input and output pixel values. geometric mean Return the square root of the product of the input and output pixel values. harmonic mean Return the product of the input and output pixel values, multiplied by 2 and divided by their sum. 🔗contrast enhancing modes The following modes are not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; blending color space as they rely on an assumption of \u0026ldquo;50% mid gray\u0026rdquo; which only applies to display-referred and non-linear color spaces. In addition, they clamp pixel values of both input and output images as the underlying math is not valid outside the range 0..1, and can thus cause visible changes anywhere in the image. To avoid these, you will need to ensure that the module\u0026rsquo;s input does not exceed the display-referred range.\noverlay This mode combines the \u0026ldquo;multiply\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;screen\u0026rdquo; blend modes: The parts of the input where the output is brighter, become brighter; The parts of the image where the output is darker, become darker; Mid-gray is unaffected. This mode is often combined with the lowpass and highpass modules. softlight This mode is similar to \u0026ldquo;overlay\u0026rdquo;, except the results are softer and less bright. As with overlay, it is often combined with the lowpass and highpass modules. hardlight This mode is not related to \u0026ldquo;softlight\u0026rdquo; in anything but name. Like overlay mode it is a combination of \u0026ldquo;multiply\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;screen\u0026rdquo; modes and has a different effect above and below mid-gray. The results with hardlight blend mode tend to be quite intense and usually need to be combined with a reduced opacity. vividlight This mode is an extreme version of overlay/softlight. Values darker than mid-gray are darkened; Values brighter than mid-gray are brightened. You will probably need to tone down its effect by reducing the opacity linearlight This mode is similar to the effect of \u0026ldquo;vividlight\u0026rdquo;. pinlight This mode performs a darken and lighten blending simultaneously, removing mid-tones. It can result in artifacts such as patches and blotches. 🔗color channel modes 🔗Lab channels The following are available for blending in the Lab color space only\nLab lightness Mix the lightness from the input and output images, while taking the color channels (a and b) unaltered from the input image. In contrast to “lightness” this blend mode does not involve any color space conversion and does not clamp any data. In some cases this blend mode is less prone to artifacts than “lightness”. Lab a-channel Mix the Lab \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; color channel from the input and output images, while taking the other channels unaltered from the input image. Lab b-channel Mix the Lab \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; color channel from the input and output images, while taking the other channels unaltered from the input image. Lab color Mix the Lab color channels (a and b) from the input and output images, while taking the lightness unaltered from the input image. In contrast to “color” this blend mode does not involve any color space conversion and does not clamp any data. In some cases this blend mode is less prone to artifacts than “color”. 🔗RGB channels The following are available when blending in RGB color spaces only.\nRGB red channel Mix the \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; channel from the input and output images, while taking the other channels unaltered from the input image. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, the \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; channel from the output image is multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. RGB green channel Mix the \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; channel from the input and output images, while taking the other channels unaltered from the input image. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, the \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; channel from the output image is multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. RGB blue channel Mix the \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; channel from the input and output images, while taking the other channels unaltered from the input image. When blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space, the \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; channel from the output image is multiplied by a value proportional to the \u0026ldquo;blend fulcrum\u0026rdquo;. 🔗HSV channels The following are available when blending in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (display)\u0026rdquo; color space only.\nHSV value Mix the lightness from the input and output images, while taking color unaltered from the input image. In contrast to “lightness” this blend mode does not involve clamping. HSV color Mix the color from the input and output images, while taking lightness unaltered from the input image. In contrast to “color” this blend mode does not involve clamping. 🔗others lightness Mix lightness from the input and output images, while taking color (chromaticity and hue) unaltered from the input image. chromaticity Mix chromaticity from the input and output images, while taking lightness and hue unaltered from the input image. This blend mode uses RGB ratios, divided by a Euclidean norm. lighten not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space Compare the pixel values of the input and output images, and output the lighter value. darken not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space Compare the pixel values of the input and output images, and output the darker value. hue not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space Mix hue (color tint) from the input and output images, while taking lightness and chroma unaltered from the input image. color not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space Mix color (chroma and hue) from the input and output images while taking lightness unaltered from the input image. Caution: When modules drastically modify hue (e.g. when generating complementary colors) this blend mode can result in strong color noise.\ncoloradjustment not available in the \u0026ldquo;RGB (scene)\u0026rdquo; color space Some modules act predominantly on the tonal values of an image but also perform some color saturation adjustments (e.g. the levels and tone curve modules). This blend mode takes the lightness from the module\u0026rsquo;s output and mixes colors from input and output, enabling control over the module\u0026rsquo;s color adjustments.

If you wish to process multiple images or multiple folders use the --import option instead. \u0026lt;xmp file\u0026gt; The optional name of an XMP sidecar file containing the history stack data to be applied during export. If this option is not provided darktable will search for an XMP file that belongs to the given input file(s). \u0026lt;output file or folder\u0026gt; The name of the output file or destination folder. The parameter is mandatory if you use the program on an image folder containing multiple images, and it must point to an existing folder. If the specified path does not point to an existing folder, it is interpreted as a filename. If the path is interpreted as a filename, the export file format is derived from the file extension, unless the --out-ext option is present (see below). Note that the file extension is only used to determine the export format, which then enforces the actual output extension (e.g. image.jpeg sets the format to JPEG, which results in the filename image.jpg). You can also use a number of variables in the output filename. If you specify output folder it is recommended that you also specify the file format with --out-ext. --width \u0026lt;max width\u0026gt; Limit the width of the exported image to the given number of pixels. --height \u0026lt;max height\u0026gt; Limit the height of the exported image to the given number of pixels. --hq \u0026lt;0|1|true|false\u0026gt; Define whether to use high quality resampling during export (see the export module reference for more details).

Disabling this option allows you to run multiple instances of darktable-cli at the cost of being unable to use the --style option. Defaults to true. --out-ext \u0026lt;extension\u0026gt; Defines the export format to use (e.g. jpeg, tiff, openexr) based on the provided argument string, which can be a common extension (e.g. jpg, tif, exr) or a format (e.g. jpeg, tiff). The name --out-ext is preserved for compatibility with existing scripts, but it is actually used to determine the format, not the file extension; the extension, as always, is determined by the format. If specified, this format takes precedence over the one derived from \u0026lt;output file\u0026gt;. If the output filename already contains an extension, it is removed only if it exactly matches the string passed to --out-ext. Otherwise, it is treated as part of the filename (e.g. output.jpg with --out-ext jpeg results in output.jpg.jpg, because jpg does not match jpeg). Defaults to jpg if \u0026lt;output folder\u0026gt; is specified. --import \u0026lt;file or dir\u0026gt; Specify input file or folder, can be used multiple times.

There are two ways to alter this configuration when using darktable-cli, as described below.\n🔗use the export module The darktable-cli command will use the last format configuration used in the export module, when run in interactive (gui) mode. You may therefore manually set your desired format options in the darktable gui and then run darktable-cli to export your files.\n🔗pass options on the command-line You can set any export format configuration option using the following syntax:\n--core --conf plugins/imageio/format/\u0026lt;FORMAT\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;OPTION\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;VALUE\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;FORMAT\u0026gt; is the name of the desired output format and \u0026lt;OPTION\u0026gt; is any configuration option for that format.\nAn option set in this way will not be permanently stored but will be used just for this run of darktable-cli.\nThe following sections describe the configuration options/values that are available for each export format:\n🔗jpeg quality The compression quality (5 - 100) 🔗j2k (jpg2000) format The format of the output 0: J2K 1: jp2 quality The compression quality (5 - 100) preset The DCP mode 0: Cinema2K, 24 FPS 1: Cinema2K, 48 FPS 2: Cinema4K, 24 FPS 🔗exr (OpenEXR) bpp The bit depth (16 or 32) compression The compression type 0: uncompressed 1: RLE 2: ZIPS 3: ZIP 4: PIZ 5: PXR24 6: B44 7: DWAA 8: DWAB 🔗pdf title The title of the pdf (any character) size The size of the pdf (a4, a3, letter, legal) orientation the paper orientation of the pdf 0: portrait 1: landscape border The empty space around the pdf; format: size (a number) + unit; examples: 10 mm, 1 inch dpi The resolution in dots per inch inside the pdf (1 - 5000) rotate Whether to rotate the pdf (0 or 1) icc Whether to embed an icc profile (0 or 1) bpp The bit depth (8 or 16) compression Whether to compress the pdf (0 or 1) mode The mode to put the images in the pdf 0: normal: just put the images into the pdf 1: draft: images are replaced with boxes 2: debug: only show the outlines and bounding boxen 🔗pfm No options provided.\n🔗png bpp The bit depth (8 or 16) compression The compression level (0 - 9) 🔗ppm No options provided.\n🔗tiff bpp The bit depth (8, 16, 32) compress The compression type 0: uncompressed 1: deflate 2: deflate with predictor compresslevel The compression level (0 - 9) shortfile B\u0026amp;W or color image 0: write rgb colors 1: write grayscale 🔗webp comp_type The compression type 0: lossy 1: lossless quality the compression quality (5 - 100) hint The preferred way to manage the compression 0: default 1: picture: digital picture, like portrait, inner shot 2: photo: outdoor photograph, with natural lighting 3: graphic: discrete tone image (graph, map-tile, etc.) 🔗copy No options provided.\n🔗xcf bpp The bit depth (8, 16, 32) 🔗JXL bpp The bit depth (8, 10, 12, 16, 32) pixel_type Boolean whether the (16 bit) pixel type is unsigned integer or floating point 0: unsigned integer 1: floating point quality Integer (4-100): the quality of the image, roughly corresponding to JPEG quality (100 is lossless) original Boolean whether to encode using the original color profile or the internal XYB one 0: internal 1: original effort Integer between 1-9.

In general this requires your monitor to be properly calibrated and profiled, and it needs the profile to be correctly installed on your system. darktable queries your X display server\u0026rsquo;s xatom as well as the system service colord (if available) for the right profile. If required you can enforce a specific method in preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous.\nTo investigate your display profile configuration you can run the darktable-cmstest binary (Linux only) which prints out useful information (e.g. profile name per-monitor) and tells you if the system is correctly configured.\nIn rare cases you may need to manually select the display profile.

Shapes can be used alone or in combination. Once a shape has been drawn on an image it can be adjusted, removed, or reused in other modules.\nShapes are stored internally as vectors and are rendered with the required resolution during pixelpipe processing. Shapes are expressed in the coordinate system of the original image and are transformed along with the rest of the image by any active distorting modules in the pipe (lens correction, rotate and perspective for example). This means that a shape will always work on the same image area regardless of any modifications that may be subsequently applied.\nThe controls required to create and alter drawn masks may be enabled by selecting either the \u0026ldquo;drawn mask\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;drawn \u0026amp; parametric mask\u0026rdquo; icon at the bottom of a module. You can also create and edit shapes using the mask manager module.\n🔗creating shapes Choose a shape by clicking on the appropriate shape icon (from left to right: circle, ellipse, path, brush, gradient).\nThis will take you into the creation mode for that shape. Once you have finished drawing your shape you will automatically be taken into edit mode.\nCtrl+click on the shape icon to continuously draw multiple shapes of the same type \u0026ndash; each time a shape is completed, you will re-enter creation mode for a new instance of that shape. While in continuous creation mode, right-click on the image to stop drawing shapes and enter edit mode.\nFor all drawn shapes, you can hold Shift while scrolling with the mouse wheel to change the extent of the shape\u0026rsquo;s feathering (the blur at the edge of the shape) and use Ctrl+scroll to change the shape\u0026rsquo;s opacity (how transparent it is). The feathering shape can also be changed by dragging a node on the feathering outline. If the feathering node coincides with a path node, hold Shift when selecting the node to limit selection to feathering nodes. These operations are available in both creation and edit modes (as long as your mouse is over the shape in question).\nBy default, scrolling your mouse up increases the value of the relevant shape parameters. This behavior can be changed in preferences \u0026gt; darkroom \u0026gt; scroll down to increase mask parameters.\nNote: When used in shape creation mode, the preceding scroll operations will also cause the default feathering or opacity to be changed. The new default values will be used the next time you create a new shape.\n🔗editing shapes Click on the \u0026lsquo;show and edit mask elements\u0026rsquo; icon to enter shape edit mode. This will show all drawn masks in use by the current module and allow you to edit those shapes. It will also expand the associated group in the mask manager. Ctrl+click on the same icon to enter restricted edit mode, where certain actions (e.g. dragging a complete shape or changing its size) are blocked. This is particularly useful to avoid costly mistakes when editing path and brush shapes.\nClick and drag a shape to move it around the image canvas. Clicking on a shape will also select that shape in the mask manager.\n🔗removing shapes While in edit mode right-click on a shape to remove it.\n🔗reusing shapes You can reuse shapes that you have drawn in other modules. Click on the shapes drop-down (next to the \u0026lsquo;show and edit mask elements\u0026rsquo; button) to choose previously-drawn shapes individually or to use the same group of shapes as used by another module. The following options are available for selection:\nadd existing shape Choose either an individual shape or a group of shapes that you\u0026rsquo;ve drawn previously (either within the mask manager or from within the drawn mask of another module). If that shape or group is used elsewhere, any changes you make will be reflected everywhere the shape or group is used. use same shapes as Add a list of shapes used in another module to the current module\u0026rsquo;s mask. This differs from the previous option in that it creates a new group of shapes, allowing shapes to be added to or removed from the group independently of the module from which they were copied. All shapes that are common to both groups remain linked. 🔗combining and managing shapes The mask manager module can be used to manage your drawn shapes. This module also allows you to group and combine drawn masks using set operators (union, intersection, difference, exclusion).\n🔗shape distortions In order to ensure a consistent co-ordinate system, when you place a shape on the image, it is actually drawn on the original RAW file. This shape then passes up through the pixelpipe before finally being used by the module and drawn on the screen. This means that, if you have enabled any distorting modules (such as lens correction), drawn shapes may appear distorted on the screen and in the final image. This can lead, for example, to circles being rendered as ellipses and gradient lines becoming curved. If you need to create a more accurate shape (to overcome these distortions) it is recommended that you avoid using the simple shapes (circles / ellipses) in favor of the path shape (which can be drawn using more points, reducing distortions). You can adjust the curve on gradient lines to overcome the simple distortions introduced by lens correction.\n🔗available shapes circle Click on the image canvas to place the circle. Scroll while hovering over the circle to change its diameter. Scroll while hovering over the circle\u0026rsquo;s border to change the width of the feathering (the same effect as holding Shift while scrolling with the mouse wheel within the main shape). ellipse The general principle is the same as for the circle shape. In addition, four nodes are shown on the ellipse line. Click and drag the nodes to adjust the ellipse\u0026rsquo;s eccentricity. Ctrl+click and drag the nodes or use Shift+Ctrl+scroll (with the mouse wheel) to rotate the ellipse. Alt+click within the shape to toggle the gradual decay between equidistant and proportional mode. path Click on the image canvas to place three or more nodes and generate a free-format enclosed shape. Terminate the path by right-clicking after having set the last point. By default, nodes are connected with smooth lines. If you want a node to instead define a sharp corner, you can do so by creating it with Ctrl+click. In edit mode Ctrl+click on an existing node to convert it from smooth to sharp corners and vice versa. Ctrl+click on one of the line segments to insert an additional node. Right-click on a node to delete it. Take care to ensure that the mouse pointer is over the desired node and the node is highlighted, to avoid accidentally removing the whole path.\nThe size of the completed shape can be modified by scrolling. The same holds true for the width of the border (the area with a gradual opacity decay), which can also be changed with Shift+scroll (with the mouse wheel) from anywhere within the shape. Single nodes as well as path segments can be moved by dragging them with the mouse. If a node is selected by clicking on it, two Bézier handles appear which allow you to modify the curvature of the line (reset to the default curvature by right-clicking on either of the handles). In the image below, the selected node (2) has two handles (4 and 5). Altering the position or length of the handles alters the curvature between node 2 and the adjacent nodes (1 and 3).\nDragging one of the control points on the border adjusts the border width just in that part of the shape.\nConsider fine-tuning paths in restricted edit mode (enabled by Ctrl+clicking on the \u0026lsquo;show and edit mask elements\u0026rsquo; icon). This allows you to adjust single nodes and segments without the risk of accidentally shifting or resizing the whole shape.\nbrush Start drawing a brush stroke by left-clicking on the image canvas and moving the mouse while keeping the button pressed. The brush stroke is finalized once you release the mouse button. Scroll the mouse to change the shape size and Shift+scroll to change the feathering (hardness), either before you start drawing or at any time during the operation. Likewise you can use the \u0026ldquo;{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}\u0026rdquo; keys to decrease/increase hardness, and the \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; keys to decrease/increase opacity. If you have a graphics tablet with pen pressure sensitivity, darktable can apply the recorded pen pressure to certain attributes of the brush stroke. This operation can be controlled in preferences \u0026gt; darkroom \u0026gt; pen pressure control for brush masks.\nOn lifting the tablet pen or releasing the left mouse button the brush stroke is converted into a number of connected nodes, which define the final shape. A configuration option (preferences \u0026gt; darkroom \u0026gt; smoothing of brush strokes) controls how much smoothing is applied. A higher level of smoothing leads to fewer nodes being created – this eases subsequent editing at the expense of lower accuracy.\nNodes and segments of a brush stroke can be modified individually. See the documentation on path shapes (above) for more details. Change the size or hardness of a node by scrolling and Shift+scrolling over a node, respectively.\nNote: Rendering a complex brush shape can consume a significant number of CPU cycles. Consider using the circle, ellipse or path shapes instead where possible.\ngradient The gradient shape is a linear gradient which extends from a given point to the edge of the image. Click on the image canvas to define the position of the line that defines 50% opacity. Dotted lines indicate the distance beyond which the opacity is 100% and 0%. Between these dotted lines the opacity changes linearly.\nThe line has two anchor nodes which you can drag to change the rotation of the gradient. You can also set the rotation angle when placing the gradient shape by clicking and dragging to place the shape.\nGradient lines can also be curved by scrolling with your mouse while hovering close to the center line. This can be useful to counteract the distortion caused by the lens correction module.\nDepending on the module and the underlying image, using a gradient shape might provoke banding artifacts. You should consider activating the dither or posterize module to alleviate this.\n🔗reversing the polarity of a drawn mask Click on the \u0026ldquo;+/-\u0026rdquo; button to reverse the polarity of the entire drawn mask. For example, a circular mask will, by default, cause the module to be applied only to the area inside the drawn circle. Reversing its polarity will cause the module to apply to the whole image, except for that circle.\n🔗panning and zooming the image While creating or editing a shape, mouse actions are applied to the current shape. If you need to move or zoom the portion of the image shown in the center view, hold down the \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; key while dragging the mouse or using the scroll wheel. While the key is held down, the mouse actions will apply to the entire image rather than the current shape.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn/","tags":null,"title":"drawn masks"},{"categories":null,"content":"Control the overall look and feel of darktable.\ninterface language Set the language of the user interface. This includes the option to enable sentence case (en@truecase) for English. The system default is marked with an * (needs a restart) theme Set the theme for the user interface. Aside from any aesthetic considerations, the recommended interface color for color evaluation is middle gray. Visual perception is affected by ambient brightness, and a low user interface brightness causes all kinds of illusions. Using a dark interface to retouch photos can therefore lead to excessive retouching (abuse of contrast and saturation) and to a photo that is too dark when printed. It is therefore highly recommended that you use one of the \u0026ldquo;grey\u0026rdquo; themes for retouching work as these are designed so that the user interface approximates middle gray. For those who have difficulty reading text in the default theme, darktable includes two \u0026ldquo;highcontrast\u0026rdquo; themes with white text on a dark background, but the caveats mentioned previously apply if you select one of them (default \u0026ldquo;darktable-elegant-grey\u0026rdquo;). use system font size Select this option to use the font size defined by your system.

Click this button to reset to default values. 🔗CSS theme modifications In addition to selecting a pre-built theme you can also apply additional CSS customizations of your own to tweak the look-and-feel of darktable.\nTwo different methods are provided for this:\ncreate a custom theme If you wish to make a large number of changes to darktable\u0026rsquo;s UI you may wish to create your own theme (in a .css file) and place it in $HOME/.config/darktable/themes (or C:\\%LOCALAPPDATA%\\darktable\\themes on Windows). Your new theme will automatically appear in the theme selection list the next time you restart darktable. Please note that the structure of darktable\u0026rsquo;s internal CSS changes frequently and you may need to make significant changes to your own themes when new versions of darktable are released. For this reason (among others) we do not recommend creating complex custom themes unless you are willing to devote a lot of time to ongoing maintenance. If your theme loads any of darktable\u0026rsquo;s pre-built themes using the @import url directive, note that your CSS theme file may not be portable between installations (@import url uses relative paths and the location of the pre-built themes is system-dependent).\ncreate theme tweaks A text box is provided at the bottom of the general tab within which you can enter your own CSS tweaks. When using this option, darktable will first load your selected theme (the \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; theme, chosen in the theme drop-down) and then apply your custom CSS on top. This means that you can easily make minor alterations to the look-and-feel, while still keeping mostly up-to-date with core theme changes when a new version of darktable is released. It also means that you can usually change your base theme without affecting your custom CSS tweaks. When you have finished entering your CSS, click the \u0026ldquo;save CSS and apply\u0026rdquo; button. This will save your CSS to $HOME/.config/darktable/user.css (or C:\\%LOCALAPPDATA%\\darktable\\user.css on Windows) and immediately apply it to the current darktable session.\nIf you notice any issues after applying your CSS, you can uncheck the \u0026ldquo;modify selected theme with CSS tweaks below\u0026rdquo; box to revert. This will immediately restore the base theme but will leave your tweaks in the editor so that you can re-edit them and try again. Simply press \u0026ldquo;save CSS and apply\u0026rdquo; again when you are ready to retry. This will automatically re-check the \u0026ldquo;modify selected theme with CSS tweaks below\u0026rdquo; checkbox and apply the new CSS.\nNote: If you have any issues while using custom CSS tweaks please retry with the \u0026ldquo;modify selected theme with CSS tweaks below\u0026rdquo; option unchecked to be certain that they were not caused by any of your alterations.\n🔗understanding darktable\u0026rsquo;s themes All of darktable\u0026rsquo;s pre-built themes are provided as CSS files in $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/themes/ (where $DARKTABLE is darktable\u0026rsquo;s installation directory). The darktable.css theme contains the bulk of the code used to control the look-and-feel of darktable. A number of other themes are also provided but most of them use darktable.css as a base (by importing darktable.css using the @import url directive).\nIf you choose to create your own custom theme file you are advised to follow a similar approach \u0026ndash; import one of darktable\u0026rsquo;s existing theme files using @import url (this directive expects relative paths) and then apply your own customizations on top. You do not need to do this when using the CSS text box in the preferences dialog \u0026ndash; attempting to use @import url in the CSS tweaks text box will not work correctly.\nThemes use the same basic CSS principles as in html browsers (with some minor exceptions \u0026ndash; see the Gtk documentation for details):\nThe majority of the style properties are assigned to broad groups of UI elements, for example, Gtk buttons and text entry fields Next, related groups of darktable-specific UI elements are given class names allowing them to be styled as a group Finally, some unique UI elements are assigned a CSS id so that they can be styled independently You are encouraged to explore the existing themes (darktable.css in particular is very well commented) and to make use of the Gtk Inspector tool to figure out how to select the specific UI element (or class of elements) you wish to modify. Some experimentation will be required.\nPlease note that darktable themes are grayscale by default in order that users not be distracted by strong colors while editing images. You are advised to retain this practice in your own themes and to keep the average shade as close to middle-gray as possible. In addition you are advised to review your custom CSS each time darktable is updated, to ensure that changes to the application have not adversely affected your tweaks.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/general/","tags":null,"title":"general"},{"categories":null,"content":"As you can imagine, the hardware architecture of GPUs can vary significantly. There are different manufacturers, and even different generations of GPUs from the same manufacturer may not be comparable. At the same time GPU manufacturers don\u0026rsquo;t normally disclose all the hardware details of their products to the public. One of the consequences of this is the need to use proprietary drivers under Linux, if you want to take full advantage of your graphics card.\nFortunately an industry consortium lead by The Khronos Group has developed an open, standardized interface called OpenCL, which allows your GPU to be used as a numerical processing device. OpenCL offers a C99-like programming language with a strong focus on parallel computing. An application that wants to use OpenCL will need OpenCL source code that it hands over to a hardware-specific compiler at run-time. This way applications can use OpenCL on different GPU architectures (even at the same time). All of the hardware “secrets” are hidden in this compiler and are normally not visible to the user (or the application).

This will create entries for your images in darktable\u0026rsquo;s library database so that it can keep track of the changes you make. There are three ways to import images, each accessible through buttons in the import module:\nadd to library This option adds images to the library without copying or moving \u0026ndash; your original files will stay in their current location and will not be altered. On import, darktable will read the metadata from the image files and any accompanying XMP sidecar file. If an image has already been added to the database, any updates you have made to the sidecar file will be loaded. copy \u0026amp; import Copies the images to the storage location (following the file naming pattern defined in preferences \u0026gt; import), then adds the copied images to the library \u0026ndash; the original images are not changed or moved. Only the images are copied and if an existing XMP sidecar file is available for the image, it will not be read, copied or used. copy \u0026amp; import from camera Connect the camera to your system with a USB cable (if your camera is auto-mounted by your system, you will need to un-mount it before it can be accessed by darktable). If you don\u0026rsquo;t see your camera listed in the import module, press the \u0026ldquo;scan for devices\u0026rdquo; button. Once your camera is detected the import module should offer the ability to copy \u0026amp; import images from the camera. Clicking the \u0026ldquo;copy \u0026amp; import\u0026rdquo; button physically copies the selected images from the camera into a specified directory (following the file naming pattern defined in preferences \u0026gt; import) and then adds the copied images to the library. Once images have been imported, their thumbnails are displayed in the lighttable view, within which you can organize and catalog your imported images \u0026ndash; please refer to the digital asset management section for more information.\nThe primary use for the lighttable view is to review your images and decide which you would like to edit further and which to discard. The following is a possible culling process to choose which images to edit/delete:\nSet the lighttable view to only show images with a rating of exactly 1 star using the view setting on the top panel. Since darktable assigns a 1 star rating to newly-imported images by default, this will show all of the images you have just imported. You can use the collections module to further refine your selection if needed. Perform a quick first-level screening of your images: If any images are badly out-of-focus or otherwise unwanted, reject them or give them a 0-star rating (by pressing the \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; keys, respectively, while hovering over the image with your mouse). If you would like an image to pass to the next review phase, press 2 to give it a 2 star rating. Any images that no longer have a 1 star rating will automatically disappear from view. Continue in this manner until no more images remain visible in the lighttable view. Alter the lighttable view to only show images with 2 stars. Go through these images more carefully, and decide whether to promote them to a 3 star rating, or put them back down to a lower rating. Again, proceed until no more images remain in the lighttable view. Alter the lighttable view to only show images with 3 stars. Perform quick edits and experiments on those images in the darkroom view to decide if they are worthy of further effort. If you are happy with the results of those edits, promote that image to a 4 star rating for final editing. Go through your 4 star images, perform any final edits on them and then export to see the final result. Increase the rating a final time to 5 stars to indicate that processing is complete. If space is at a premium you might consider permanently deleting your rejected or 0-star images. Select these images in the lighttable view and use the \u0026rsquo;trash/delete\u0026rsquo; option in the actions on selection module.

The aim here is not to make darktable a drop-in replacement for any other software, but rather to help you to recover part of the work you have already invested into your image.

For this reason, darktable includes various types of pixelpipe, optimised for different parts of the system. For example:\nThe export pixelpipe processes the full-sized image at full quality. This is the slowest type of pixelpipe, but provides the maximum available image quality. The thumbnail pixelpipe is optimised for speed, since it needs to process multiple small images at the same time without impacting lighttable or filmstrip performance. These optimisations impact image quality, but this is not usually a problem for the small images used in thumbnail generation. The standard darkroom pixelpipe attempts to produce as accurate an image as possible, while also maintaining responsiveness when modifying module parameters. It does this by only processing the pixels that are visible on-screen \u0026ndash; known as the \u0026ldquo;region of interest\u0026rdquo; (ROI). However, this can mean that the image doesn\u0026rsquo;t accurately reflect the exported file, especially when using modules that rely on the properties of neighboring pixels. This is particularly noticeable in modules that impact local contrast (e.g. diffuse or sharpen, denoise (profiled) and local contrast) and can mean that the darkroom view appears over-sharpened compared to a full-sized export. A cut-down darkroom pixelpipe is used while interacting with some darkroom modules that display the full image with overlays (like retouch, crop and liquify). This pixelpipe excludes some long-running modules (like diffuse or sharpen) in order to improve responsiveness, but can temporarily make the image look under-processed (blurred). This limitation is removed as soon as you move focus to a different module. In order to overcome the above limitations within the standard darkroom pixelpipe, you can enable high quality processing mode in the darkroom view. This mode processes the entire image using the export pixelpipe and only downscales for display at the end of the pipe. This means that the darkroom image will very closely match the exported image, but will significantly degrade responsiveness when interacting with processing modules. You are advised to only use this mode after you have already done most of your processing. Its performance will be significantly improved by using an OpenCL-capable GPU. 🔗module order and workflows The order in which modules are executed within the pixelpipe has been carefully chosen to give the best output quality. In previous versions of darktable it was not possible to change the module order. However, there are a number of very specific use cases where the movement of some modules within the pixelpipe is advised.\nOne of the main reasons to change the module order came about with darktable version 3.0, which introduced the new scene-referred way of working. Version 3.2 formalised this by introducing the display-referred and scene-referred workflows, which are controlled by the preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults setting. Starting with version 3.6, scene-referred workflow is now the official recommended (and default) way to use darktable.\nThe scene-referred workflow attempts to perform as many operations as possible in a linear RGB color space, only compressing the tones to fit the output medium (with a non-linear tone mapping) at the end of the pixelpipe. This has the advantage of being a more physically-realistic space to do transformations than the traditional display-referred workflow, which attempts to perform operations in a non-linear perceptual color space. Honoring the physical realism (rather than the perceptual realism) makes it much easier to produce predictable processing algorithms with a minimum of artifacts.\nThe following diagram should help you to understand the difference between these workflows:\nScene-referred modules process linear data that is proportional to the amount of light collected by the camera at the scene. The dynamic range of an image in the scene-referred section of the pixelpipe is often larger than that of the display medium.\nAt some point in the pixelpipe, these pixel values are compressed by a non-linear tone mapping operation into a smaller dynamic range more suitable for display on a monitor or a print.\nThe remaining modules operate in the non-linear display-referred section of the pixelpipe to produce the final output image.\n🔗display-referred workflow Prior to version 3.0 darktable\u0026rsquo;s workflow was display-referred (auto-apply pixel workflow defaults = \u0026ldquo;display-referred\u0026rdquo;) and this option is still provided as a legacy mode. In this workflow, the base curve or filmic rgb module performs tone mapping early in the pixelpipe and most other darktable modules operate on image data in the compressed display-referred space.\nSelecting the display-referred workflow enables the legacy (pre-darktable-3.0) module order and automatically switches on the base curve module for new images.\nPixel data within the display-referred space is non-linear and is not a physically realistic representation of the original scene. This can lead to various artifacts with some modules, hence the creation of the (now default) scene-referred workflow.\n🔗scene-referred workflow Scene-referred workflow (auto-apply pixel workflow defaults = \u0026ldquo;scene-referred\u0026rdquo;) was introduced as part of darktable 3.0. The module order was entirely rearranged to place the filmic rgb and base curve tone mapping modules much later in the pixelpipe. This means that most modules now operate in linear rgb space with only a few modules remaining within the non-linear display-referred space. Within this workflow it is now recommended that the majority of image processing takes place using the modules up to and including filmic rgb. Operations in this section of the pixelpipe, being truly linear, are much more physically realistic and produce fewer artifacts.\nSelecting the scene-referred workflow enables the v5.0 module order and automatically enables the exposure and filmic rgb modules with some presets designed to act as a reasonable starting point for scene-referred editing.\n🔗changing module order It remains highly recommended that users not change the order within the pixelpipe for a number of reasons:\nThe sequence of modules has been selected with great care in order to give highest output quality. Changes to the sequence often worsen the result rather than improving it. Some processing modules simply don\u0026rsquo;t make sense if they are shifted in the pixelpipe. For example, highlight reconstruction needs to be performed on raw data before demosaic, which itself needs to be performed before any input color profile can be applied. For this reason it is still not possible to move some of the modules that are placed early in the pixelpipe. Most processing modules are designed to work within a specific color space (see the color management section for more details). Full flexibility would require modules to support different parallel algorithms depending on the color space they are working in, which would drastically increase complexity. Despite the general recommendation to leave the pixelpipe order alone, it is possible to move modules within the pixelpipe by holding Ctrl+Shift and dragging and dropping the desired module to a new location. This should only be done by experienced users who understand the impact this will have on the image.\nThe module order can be manually changed back to either the v5.0, v3.0 or legacy versions using the module order module, which can also be used to define your own custom module order presets.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/the-pixelpipe-and-module-order/","tags":null,"title":"the pixelpipe \u0026 module order"},{"categories":null,"content":"The slideshow view is still in an early stage of development with only a basic set of features.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t need the auto-advance mode, you could even use the sticky preview feature instead.\nspacebar start and stop auto-advance mode which automatically switches to the next images every five seconds by default.

Most modern graphics cards from NVIDIA, Intel or AMD come with full OpenCL support. The OpenCL compiler is normally shipped as part of the proprietary graphics driver and is used as a dynamic library called libOpenCL.so. This library must be in a folder where it can be found by your system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic linker.\nWhen darktable starts, it will first try to find and load libOpenCL.so and \u0026ndash; on success \u0026ndash; checks if the available graphics card comes with OpenCL support. A minimally-sufficient amount of graphics memory (1GB+) needs to be available for darktable to take advantage of the GPU. If that check passes, darktable tries to setup its OpenCL environment: a processing context needs to be initialized, a calculation pipeline to be started, OpenCL source code files (extension is .cl) needs to be read and compiled and the included routines (OpenCL kernels) need to be prepared for darktable\u0026rsquo;s modules. If all of that completes successfully, the preparation is complete.\nBy default, OpenCL support is activated in darktable if all the above steps were successful. If you want to de-activate it you can do so in preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; OpenCL. This configuration parameter is grayed out if the OpenCL initialization failed.\nYou can switch OpenCL support off and on at any time without requiring a restart. Depending on the type of modules you are using, you will notice the effect as a general speed-up during interactive work and export.

After each run of the pixelpipe you will be shown details of processing time for each module plus an even more fine-grained profile for all used OpenCL kernels.\nApart from the speed-up you should not see any difference in the results between CPU and GPU processing. Except for some rounding errors, the results are designed to be identical.

It is recommended that you only use auto mode in situations where the ambient light will change significantly during the time of the shoot, for example, when shooting a timelapse over 24 hours.\nThe camera settings module can be used to define the delay (the number of seconds between capture) and sequence (the number of images to capture) of your timelapse.\nTo start the timelapse click the capture button in the same panel and watch the filmstrip fill up with images. The last captured image is always displayed in the center view.\n🔗storing images on the camera and computer By default, the gphoto2 framework (used by darktable\u0026rsquo;s tethering feature) will only download images to your computer, and will not store them on the camera\u0026rsquo;s memory card.

These parameters are color coordinates rather than the geometrical coordinates used in drawn masks.\nFor each data channel of a module (e.g. Lab, RGB) and several virtual data channels (e.g. hue, saturation) you can construct a per-channel opacity function. Depending on each pixel\u0026rsquo;s value for a given data channel this function calculates a blending factor between 0 and 1 (100%) for that pixel.\nEach pixel of an image thus has different blending factors for each of its data channels.

The g (gray) value is calculated as a weighted average of the R, G \u0026amp; B channels, the exact weightings depending on the working color space being used. The JzCzhz color space is a polar representation of the Jzazbz color space, in the same way that LCh is a polar representation of the Lab space. Like the L in Lab color space, the Jz is a representation of the luminosity of a pixel that aligns with how we perceive brightness. However, the Jzazbz color space is much better for high dynamic range images and is less susceptible to hue shifts than Lab space.\nSee Wikipedia for more details about these color spaces.\nTwo sliders can be shown for each associated data channel: one that works on the input data that the module receives and one that works on the output data that the module produces prior to blending. The sliders for the output data channels are hidden by default and can be shown using the show output channels option in the blending menu.\nThe boost factor slider allows the range of values targeted by the parametric mask sliders to be extended. It may be used in scene referred editing, where luminance values may extend beyond 100%, to target highlights. This slider is only available for channels where it is meaningful.\n🔗inspecting data channels \u0026amp; masks Press the letter C while hovering over a channel\u0026rsquo;s input/output slider to view the input/output image data for that color channel. The center image changes to display that color channel either in gray-scale values or in false colors depending on the setting in preferences \u0026gt; darkroom \u0026gt; display of individual color channels.\nPress the letter M to see the resulting mask for that slider overlaid on the image.\nWhen the mouse pointer leaves the slider the image returns to normal after a short delay.\n🔗linear / log mode Press the letter A while hovering over the a slider to change its display to \u0026rsquo;log\u0026rsquo; mode. This provides more fine control in the shadows. Press A again to toggle back to \u0026rsquo;linear\u0026rsquo; mode.\n🔗channel input/output sliders With each color channel slider you can construct a trapezoidal opacity function. For this purpose there are four markers per slider. Two filled triangles above the slider mark the range of values where opacity is 1. Two open triangles below the slider mark the range values where opacity is 0. Intermediate points between full and zero are given a proportional opacity.\nThe filled triangles, or inside markers, indicate the closed (mostly narrower) edge of the trapezoidal function. The open triangles, or outside markers, indicate the open (mostly wider) edge of the trapezoidal function. The sequence of the markers always remains unchanged: they can touch one another but they cannot switch position.\nA polarity (+/-) button to the right of each the slider switches between \u0026ldquo;range select\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;range de-select\u0026rdquo; modes, with visual confirmation provided by exchanging the upper and lower triangle markers. These two types of trapezoidal functions are represented graphically in the following images.\nrange select\nrange deselect\nIn their default state all markers are at their extreme positions.\nIn this state a range select function selects the whole range of values giving an “all at 100%” mask. Starting from there one can move the sliders inwards to gradually exclude more and more parts of the image except for the remaining narrow range.\nConversely a range de-select function (enabled by toggling the polarity) by default deselects the whole range of values, giving an “all-zero” mask as a starting point. Moving the sliders inwards gradually includes more and more parts of the image except for the remaining narrow range.\n🔗pickers With the left-hand picker button you can select a point or area probe from your image. The corresponding values for the real and virtual data channels are then displayed within each color channel slider.\nWith the right-hand picker button you can automatically set the slider\u0026rsquo;s values based on the selected range. Click and drag to set the parameters for the input slider from the drawn rectangle; Ctrl+click and drag to set the parameters for the output slider.\n🔗invert Click the invert button above the sliders to invert the polarity of the entire parametric mask. This differs from the polarity buttons beside the individual sliders which just invert the parameters for the current slider/channel.\n🔗reset Click the reset button above the sliders to revert all parametric mask parameters to their default state.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric/","tags":null,"title":"parametric masks"},{"categories":null,"content":"Presets allow you to store commonly-used module settings for future use. Some modules already come with pre-defined (internal) presets and you may also define your own (user-defined). Both internal and user-defined presets can be shown by clicking the presets menu in the module header.\nMost of the functionality described here applies to processing modules only. However, presets can also be used with some utility modules. When used with utility modules, the functionality to auto-apply or auto-show presets based on image Exif data is not available.\nPlease note that, for processing modules, the saved preset also includes the active state of the module. You can use this to create your own default settings, which you can activate on-demand. Simply set your desired defaults, disable the module, and save the preset.\n🔗the presets menu The presets menu will contain one or more of the following entries depending on the presets that are defined or selected for the current module:\npreset list A list of the presets available for the current module. The currently selected preset (if any) is shown in bold and with a small check mark beside it. In addition, if the selected preset displays on a submenu, it parent entry is also highlighted in bold. edit this preset If a preset has been selected, edit the selected preset (see below). delete this preset If a preset has been selected, delete the selected preset. update preset [name] Update the named preset to match the module\u0026rsquo;s current parameters. store new preset Create a new preset using the module\u0026rsquo;s current parameters. Click on a preset name to apply the preset to the current instance of the module. Long-left-click on a preset name to apply the preset but keep the preset list open (so that you can experiment with multiple presets without needing to re-open the menu). Right-click on a preset name to create a new instance of the module and apply the selected preset to it. You can also apply a preset at any time while you are in the darkroom using a keyboard shortcut \u0026ndash; if you have assigned one (see preferences \u0026gt; shortcuts).\n🔗creating and editing presets When creating or editing presets, the following dialog is shown:\n🔗controls name The name of the preset. You can create a hierarchy of presets with shared categories by inserting vertical bar characters (\u0026quot;|\u0026quot;) in the name. For example, \u0026ldquo;Nikon|24-70mm, F2.8\u0026rdquo; would be displayed as the category \u0026ldquo;Nikon\u0026rdquo; with a submenu containing \u0026ldquo;24-70mm, F2.8\u0026rdquo; as well as any other presets whose names start with \u0026ldquo;Nikon|\u0026rdquo;. description A searchable description for the preset (optional) reset all module parameters to their default values Selecting this option will cause all module parameters to be reset to their default values (as if you had simply enabled the module on a new image or clicked the module reset button). This can be used to automatically set certain modules (color calibration, exposure, filmic) based on the Exif properties of the current image rather than setting to hard-coded parameters. Note that this option is not available when editing presets from the preferences \u0026gt; presets tab. auto apply this preset to matching images (processing modules only) Check this box to automatically apply this preset to matching images when they are opened in the darkroom for the first time (you can reapply such automatic presets by Ctrl+clicking on the reset button in the module header). Additional controls will appear to allow you to define which images the preset will be applied to based on image Exif data (see below). For example, if you want a preset to be applied to all images from a specific camera leave all fields at default values except for \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo;. Leave all fields unchanged to auto-apply a preset to all images.\nThe example dialog above sets up following rules: if the lens name matches, the aperture is greater than or equal to f/8 and the focal length is between 24 and 35mm the preset will be automatically applied.\nThe image information module displays the camera model and lens name for each image. Use this to ensure you have the correct spelling.\nIf there is more than one preset with matching parameters for a given image, darktable creates a separate module instance for each matching preset, in the order they were defined \u0026ndash; the last preset that was created will be placed after all other instances of the module in the pipeline.\nonly show this preset for matching images (processing modules only) Check this box to automatically show the preset in the preset menu, using the same set of filters. 🔗filter criteria The following criteria can be used to auto-apply or auto-show presets for processing modules:\nmodel A pattern to be matched against the Exif field that describes your camera model; use % as wildcard. maker A pattern to be matched against the Exif field that describes the maker of your camera; use % as wildcard. lens A pattern to be matched against the Exif field that describes your lens; use % as wildcard. ISO Only apply the preset if the ISO value of your image lies within the given range (shows ∞ if the upper range is unlimited). exposure Only apply the preset if the exposure time of your image lies within the given range; set + as the upper value to match arbitrarily long exposures. aperture Only apply the preset if the aperture of your image lies within the given range; set f/0 as the lower value to match arbitrarily open apertures; set f/+ as the upper value to match arbitrarily closed apertures. focal length Only apply the preset if the focal length of your image lies within the given range (from 0 to 1000). format Only apply the preset to certain types of image. Check boxes to include files matching these criteria; uncheck boxes to exclude those files. Choose from \u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;non-raw\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;HDR\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;monochrome\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo;. 🔗managing presets Both user-defined and internal presets can be viewed and managed from within preferences \u0026gt; presets.\nNote: If you create a user-defined preset with the same name as a built-in preset, your preset will override the built-in version, which will no longer be accessible.\nIf you delete a preset that has the same name as one of the built-in presets, then your user preset will be deleted, and that preset name will no longer appear in the preset menu at all. The next time you start darktable, the corresponding built-in preset will once again become visible.\n🔗module naming in the darkroom view By default, if the current parameters of a processing module match those of a saved preset, darktable will attempt to automatically set the name (label) of the module in question, as follows:\nIf the user has manually amended the name of the module in the current image, the module name will be left unchanged, If the module instance from which the preset was created had a manually-set name, any subsequent module that matches this preset will automatically be given the same name. Note that if this was unintentional, the only way to revert will be to drop and recreate the preset, since the automatic name is a hidden field in the database, If the module instance from which the preset was created did not have a manually-set name, the name of any subsequent module that matches this preset will be set to the same as the preset name. As soon as the module parameters are changed such that it no longer matches a preset, the module\u0026rsquo;s name will be reset.\nThis functionality can be disabled in preferences \u0026gt; darkroom \u0026gt; automatically update module name.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/presets/","tags":null,"title":"presets"},{"categories":null,"content":"This section is intended to get you comfortable processing images in the darkroom view using a scene-referred workflow. You are advised to follow the guidelines provided below, up to the end of the image processing in 3 modules section and then choose other areas to learn as-and-when you need to use those techniques in your images.\n🔗getting started 🔗take a well-exposed photograph Good image processing techniques start in the camera \u0026ndash; a well-exposed image (without blown highlights or heavily crushed blacks) will always make post-processing much more straightforward. Under- or over-exposure can be \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo; by darktable to some extent but no software can recover information that is not present in the Raw image (clipped highlights). Where possible, you are advised to use exposure to-the-right (ETTR) techniques to maximize the amount of data available for processing while avoiding clipping. As a general rule of thumb, in cases where the scene-dynamic-range exceeds that of your camera, it is safe to underexpose all images by 0.5 to 1 EV (by reducing the ISO sensitivity if possible) even if the in-camera preview looks darker than expected (the preview is not the raw data). If the scene dynamic range is lower than that of your camera, you may wish to dial in some over-exposure (decrease shutter speed or increase aperture) to capture more light and reduce noise.\n🔗scene-referred workflow: a new approach If you have used other Raw software in the past (or darktable prior to version 3.0) you may notice some significant differences from what you are used to \u0026ndash; darktable now uses a scene-referred approach for most of its processing modules. This approach is used extensively in cinematography and is known to be much more robust than the traditional display-referred approach.\nIn display-referred processing the data from your Raw file is initially compressed into a range that represents pure black as 0 and pure white as 1, fixing mid-gray at 0.5. A tone curve is automatically (and irreversibly) applied to this data to make the image look \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; on your display and subsequent edits are carried out on top of this already highly-modified image data. The cost of display-referred is an early loss of the relationship between pixel luminosity and saturation (usually also involving hue shifts), which is responsible for the infamous \u0026ldquo;HDR look\u0026rdquo; when the dynamic range increases.\nIn the real world, \u0026ldquo;pure black\u0026rdquo; does not really exist (there is always some light) and there is no limit to how bright things can be (so no \u0026ldquo;pure white\u0026rdquo; either). Scene-referred processing attempts to retain the physical properties of the scene for as long as possible by placing the Raw data on an unbounded linear scale and only compressing the data to the dynamic range of your display after image processing is complete.\nIn a scene-referred workflow many common tools (tone curves and levels, for example) are no longer useful ways to manipulate the image, since they rely on now-invalid definitions of black, white and gray. Experienced users may need to learn new techniques and discard old ones, but will be rewarded with much more robust and predictable outputs.\nThe scene-referred workflow in darktable enables the filmic rgb and exposure modules by default when you open new images in the darkroom view.\n🔗white balance and color calibration Most processing software uses a traditional temperature/tint model for adjusting the white balance of an image. In darktable, the color calibration module provides a much more robust and flexible approach, allowing you to explicitly define the color of the light source. This is particularly useful for scenes illuminated by artificial lighting.\nPlease note that the white balance module is still enabled in this approach, but its settings normally should not be altered.\nSet preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults to \u0026ldquo;scene-referred (filmic)\u0026rdquo; now.\nEnter preferences by clicking on the gear icon in the top panel.\n🔗edit in a controlled environment Image processing should be performed in a controlled environment, lit by a white light source against a background approximating mid-gray, and on a monitor that has been properly calibrated.\nWhile this may not be practical in many home editing environments you can control the background colors on your monitor\u0026rsquo;s display. You should set the darktable color scheme to use one of the \u0026ldquo;grey\u0026rdquo; themes and use the color assessment mode when altering tones and colors in your image. Dark themes might look good but, unless you are processing images to be viewed on a cinema screen in a darkened room, they should not be used for photo processing.\nSet preferences \u0026gt; general \u0026gt; theme to \u0026ldquo;darktable-elegant-grey\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;darktable-icons-grey\u0026rdquo; now.\n🔗enter the darkroom Choose an image to edit from the lighttable view and double-click to load that image into the darkroom view. For now try to choose an image that is well exposed \u0026ndash; we will discuss some techniques to recover badly-exposed images later.\nIn the darkroom view, you will see a list of processing modules to the right of your image. Each module performs its own processing on the image, in the order shown in the module list, starting at the bottom of the list and moving up to the top. You can think of this like a stack of building blocks where each block builds on the processing performed by the modules below it.\nOn the left hand side is the history stack (you may need to expand the module), which shows the order in which adjustments were made to the controls of the various modules. This allows you to undo changes by reverting to an earlier step in the history stack. You will see that a number of modules are applied automatically \u0026ndash; these are needed in order to generate a legible image from the Raw data.\nIt is important to understand the distinction between the order of the modules on the right-hand-side of the screen (which represents the order in which modules are executed) and the order of the modules in the history stack (which represents the order in which modules were modified).\nTo the top right is the scopes module, which shows the spread of tones/colors in your image.\nIf you have previously viewed or edited the image in the darkroom view, start by discarding history (click the reset button in the history stack). This will reapply defaults using your new settings and provide a clean starting point for editing.\n🔗why doesn\u0026rsquo;t the raw image look like the JPEG? \u0026hellip;because you haven\u0026rsquo;t processed it yet\nOne of the first things people notice when switching from lighttable to darkroom view is that the image looks different \u0026ndash; often flatter and less saturated than that shown in the lighttable view. This is because the darkroom view displays the (mostly unprocessed) Raw image, but the lighttable view initially displays the (in-camera) JPEG preview. Now that you have opened the image in the darkroom view, the lighttable view will update to show the edited version.\nMost Raw software goes to great lengths to reproduce the look of standard camera JPEGs out of the box. While this can be useful (if you only want to make very minor adjustments to the camera\u0026rsquo;s rendition of an image) we assume that you are using a Raw editor to make the image your own, and that the camera does not know how to do this. Certainly, if you are using the ETTR techniques mentioned above, the camera JPEG will rarely be close to how you want the final image to look.\nThe default settings in darktable are therefore intended to provide you with a neutral starting point for further editing and nothing more. We do not intend to change this.\n🔗module groups Below the scopes module, at the top right of the screen, is a set of tabs into which darktable\u0026rsquo;s modules are grouped. If you cannot find a module in one of the tabs you can use the search feature to locate it.\nFor the purposes of this guide, click on the hamburger icon (to the right of the tabs) and select the \u0026ldquo;workflow: scene-referred\u0026rdquo; preset now.\n🔗image processing in 3 modules The following basic adjustments are fundamental to scene-referred editing and will be required, to some extent, on the majority of images. You can usually produce a good-looking image with these steps alone.\nAs you will be adjusting the tones and colors of the image, start by enabling color assessment mode (press Ctrl+B) and perform the following edits on the zoomed-out image while in this mode.\nSet overall image brightness: First, set the overall (average) brightness of the image (the mid-gray point) by adjusting the exposure slider in the exposure module. This is a purely artistic setting and should be defined based on your intent \u0026ndash; for example, for a high-key image you will set the average brightness to be lighter than for a low-key image. The color assessment mode provides you with two reference points to assist with this by surrounding the image with a white frame against a middle-gray background.\nAt this point, don\u0026rsquo;t worry if the brightest parts of your image lose detail \u0026ndash; this can be recovered in the next step.\nNote: The lens correction module can also affect the image brightness so you may want to consider enabling it before adjusting exposure.\nSet white and black points: The next two steps use the filmic rgb module to define how the tones in your image will be mapped to the dynamic range of your display. Start by setting the white and black relative exposure sliders in the scene tab. These are purely technical settings, defining white and black relative to the mid-gray point you set in the previous step. If your image contains tones you want to treat as pure white or pure black you can use the pickers beside the sliders to set these values (using the maximum and minimum brightness of the image). Otherwise set the values manually using the color assessment frames as a reference.\nAdjust the contrast: Now move to the look tab in filmic rgb (for now we will skip the reconstruct tab). Enable the look only view at the top of the module to see a representation of the filmic tone curve, which consists of a straight section in the middle (used to set the contrast of the mid-tones) and curved sections at the top and bottom (where the shadows and highlights are compressed to fit the dynamic range of the display).\nThe contrast slider changes the slope of the straight section (the mid-tone image contrast), the latitude slider changes its length and the shadows/highlights balance slider changes its position. There is a lot of give-and-take involved here \u0026ndash; if you want to increase the contrast of the mid-tones, you must sacrifice contrast in the shadows/highlights and vice versa. The default settings of this module are tuned to work for the majority of images but you should experiment with these sliders to understand how they affect the image.\nNote: The highlight compression in the filmic rgb module can cause detail to be lost in the highlights. You can mitigate this to some extent by reducing the white relative exposure, adjusting the shadows/highlights balance or changing the contrast in highlights setting in the options tab. The tone equalizer module can also be used to reduce the relative brightness of the sky.\nColor preservation: The tone mapping in the filmic rgb module attempts to redistribute the tones in your image without affecting color reproduction. While the default color preservation algorithm works for most images, you are encouraged to experiment by changing the preserve chrominance setting in the options tab if you do not like how the colors appear.\nSaturation: Your image will probably not look very colorful at this point. You can adjust the global saturation of the image using the color balance rgb module. The \u0026ldquo;basic colorfulness\u0026rdquo; preset should provide you with generally-reasonable defaults, but you are encouraged to experiment further with these settings as required.\nNote: This guide assumes that the white balance of the image has been correctly captured by your camera. If this is not the case, you may need to make some corrections in the color calibration module first.\nYou can now switch off color assessment mode by pressing Ctrl+B again.\n🔗other processing techniques With practice the above workflow can quickly provide you with a reasonable-looking image, though most will need some additional work before they are ready for export. The following sections are intended to provide a brief outline of some more image processing techniques in darktable, with links to the relevant reference sections for more information.\nAs a general rule, you should begin with the basic steps outlined in the previous section, then perform corrections and finish with creative adjustments.\n🔗corrections 🔗color calibration Traditional white balance correction attempts to ensure that whites and grays are really neutral (R = G = B) and doesn’t really try to manage the impact on other colors. The CAT tab of the color calibration module extends this treatment to handle the remainder of the color range and works in a color space designed specifically for chromatic (color) adaptation. As with traditional white balance controls you can select a patch of neutral gray in your image to calculate the white balance, or use a selection of other automatic and manual methods. The default settings use the white balance from the image\u0026rsquo;s Exif data and are usually sufficient.\nIf you need to make adjustments in the color calibration module, you may want to also revisit any saturation corrections you made earlier in the color balance rgb module.\n🔗correct lens distortions All lenses introduce some artifacts (distortion, chromatic aberrations, vignetting) to the image. The lens correction module can correct many of these issues for a wide variety of lenses. The chromatic aberrations and raw chromatic aberrations modules can also be used to handle chromatic aberrations for lenses that are not (or only partially) supported by lens correction. In most cases simply enabling the lens correction module will auto-detect your lens and auto-apply all available corrections.\nIf you decide to use the lens correction module, it should be enabled at the start of your edit, before you adjust exposure, since vignetting correction can alter the overall brightness of your image.\n🔗reduce noise / retain detail At a pixel level there is a trade-off to be made between the retention of fine details and the reduction/removal of sensor noise. In most situations, a small amount of noise is perfectly acceptable and will not be noticeable except when you zoom in to 100%. At this scale you are not viewing the image at a realistic size \u0026ndash; even when represented on a large monitor or print, noise that is obvious at high zoom factors will be virtually invisible on the final image. However, some modules further along the image pipeline (especially those that increase local contrast) may end up exaggerating any noise that is present so, again, there are trade-offs to be made.\nThe first module you can use to manage this is demosaic, which controls how the single-color (R, G or B) pixels in your Raw file are converted to image pixels combining all three colors. Each demosaic algorithm has its own trade-offs between retaining fine detail and reducing noise. The default demosaic algorithm (RCD) usually provides a reasonable compromise.\nDemosaic algorithms can only do so much to manage noise in your image. The denoise (profiled) module is individually tuned for a number of common camera sensors and can be used to reduce or remove pixel noise. As with demosaic you should alter the settings until you are happy with the balance of denoising vs fine-detail reproduction. The default settings are usually sufficient.\n🔗sharpness and local contrast A number of modules can be used to adjust the local contrast and sharpness of your image. Most of these modules aim to enhance the apparent contrast of edges and do not add \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; sharpness (they are not the same as lens deconvolution). You should take care when using these modules as most of them can introduce artifacts (such as halos) when settings are pushed too far:\nthe contrast equalizer module allows you to adjust contrast, limiting the effect to certain feature sizes. For example you can use it to increase the contrast of fine details without impacting larger-scale objects, or vice versa the diffuse or sharpen module offers a number of presets for sharpening, lens deblurring and the addition of local contrast the local contrast module provides a simpler interface for quickly adding local contrast to your images \u0026ndash; just enabling the module or selecting one of the presets is often all that is required the sharpen module is intended to re-introduce sharpness that was removed by your camera\u0026rsquo;s anti-alias filter (if present) and can be enabled by default in preferences \u0026gt; processing. The methods listed above are usually preferred to this legacy module. As with the modules mentioned in the previous section, you should take care when adding contrast to small-scale objects \u0026ndash; an image viewed at 100% is not a realistic representation of your final edit and local contrast adjustments are usually better judged when zoomed out.\n🔗reconstruct blown highlights While a well-exposed image will make post-processing much easier, darktable does provide a few tools to handle blown highlights.\nThe highlight reconstruction module attempts to reconstruct blown highlights (colors and structure) using adjacent pixels. A number of different approaches are provided, some of which may be better on certain images, however, the default algorithm produces good results in most cases.\nEven well-reconstructed highlights can show color and edge artifacts, some of which may be exacerbated by subsequent modules in the pipe. In this case the reconstruct tab on the filmic rgb module provides additional methods to further smooth/correct highlights at the end of the processing pipeline.\n🔗adjust angle and perspective The rotate and perspective module can be used to adjust the angle of the image or to simulate the functionality of a tilt/shift lens by altering the perspective, making converging horizontal and/or vertical lines parallel (keystone correction). This latter technique is most commonly used for architectural photography. If you just want to correct the angle of the horizon you can do this by right-clicking and dragging along the horizon line.\n🔗remove spots and unwanted objects Use the retouch module to remove unwanted objects by replacing pixels with detail from elsewhere in the image. This module also offers powerful techniques for removing large-scale objects (such as spots or blemishes) while leaving fine-scale details (like hairs and follicles) intact. The most common use for this module is to remove dust spots from images or blemishes from skin.\n🔗remove atmospheric haze There are two methods for removing atmospheric haze in darktable. The haze removal module provides a much simpler interface, but the \u0026ldquo;dehaze\u0026rdquo; preset in the diffuse or sharpen module can provide more flexibility when needed.\n🔗creative adjustments 🔗crop and frame Use the crop module to crop your image and the framing module to surround your image with a colored frame. Both modules can be set to use a predefined or custom aspect ratio \u0026ndash; for example, you could place a square-cropped image into a 3:2 frame.\n🔗dodge and burn Dodging and burning is a traditional darkroom technique to add and remove brightness from an image. There are two recommended ways to achieve this\nIf you want to selectively dodge or burn only certain objects you can apply a new instance of the exposure module using a drawn mask to isolate the effect to the required area of the image (see also the mask refinement section for more information). Move the exposure slider to alter the brightness of the masked area. If you wish to dodge or burn areas with a similar brightness (for example, to brighten the shadows or darken the highlights) you should use the tone equalizer module. 🔗convert to monochrome darktable provides a number of ways to remove the color from your image. The most flexible method is to use the gray tab of the color calibration module. A number of film emulation presets are available in this module to provide you with a starting point.\nSee the developing monochrome images section for details of other techniques.\n🔗color grading The color balance rgb module is your one-stop-shop for controlling the colors in your image. Adjustments can be isolated to the shadows, highlights and mid-tones, or applied at a global level.\n🔗other important topics 🔗reuse common module settings If you find yourself using the same module parameters repeatedly, you can create presets containing your favorite settings. If you use the same settings on every image, you can also make presets apply automatically to new images. For example, you may find yourself adding the same exposure settings to every image taken by a certain camera \u0026ndash; in this case you can create a preset that automatically applies those corrections only to images from that camera.\nYou may also have groups of module settings that you commonly apply only to certain types of image. You can use styles to apply multiple module settings at once to a selection of images.\n🔗perform adjustments locally Most darktable modules can either be applied to the whole image, or restricted to parts of the image using drawn and parametric masks.\n🔗control darktable with other input methods You don\u0026rsquo;t need to use the darktable UI to make adjustments to your images. Most of the functionality in darktable can also be controlled using shortcuts defined with your keyboard/mouse and even with other input devices such as game controllers and MIDI devices. See the shortcuts section for details.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/overview/workflow/process/","tags":null,"title":"process"},{"categories":null,"content":"The quick access panel allows you to access widgets from a number of processing modules all in one place.\nThe initial set of modules (and widgets) in the panel is determined by the auto-apply pixel workflow defaults setting in processing preferences.\nYou can add or remove widgets in the panel by:\nright-clicking on the . right-clicking on the module name. using the manage module layouts screen.

A cache of the most recently used thumbnails is stored in a file on disk and loaded into memory at startup.\n🔗thumbnail creation A thumbnail is created when an image is imported into darktable for the first time, after an image has been modified in the darkroom, or when revisiting an image whose thumbnail is no longer available.\nWhen an image is imported for the first time darktable can either try to extract an embedded thumbnail from the input image (most raw files contain these, usually in JPEG format) or process the raw image itself using default settings. You can define how darktable obtains its thumbnails in preferences \u0026gt; lighttable \u0026gt; thumbnails.\nExtracting an embedded thumbnail from the input image is usually very fast. However, these thumbnails have been generated by the raw converter of the camera and do not represent darktable\u0026rsquo;s “view” of that image. You will notice the difference as soon as you open the image in the darkroom mode, at which point darktable replaces the thumbnail with its own internally processed version.\nAfter import darktable automatically generates thumbnails for new images as they are needed. When importing a large set of new images, thumbnail generation can slow down navigation in the lighttable view. Alternatively you may terminate darktable and generate the thumbnail cache separately by running darktable-generate-cache. This program will generate all missing thumbnails in one go.\nAs the thumbnail cache has a pre-defined maximum size it will eventually get filled up. If new thumbnails are subsequently added, old thumbnails are dropped from the cache. However, darktable will keep all thumbnails on disk if the corresponding disk backend option is activated in preferences \u0026gt; lighttable \u0026gt; thumbnails. Access to the thumbnails in this secondary cache is slower than the primary cache, but still much faster than reprocessing thumbnails from scratch. The size of the secondary cache is limited only by the available disk space.\nThumbnails are never removed from the secondary cache. You can manually clean the secondary cache by recursively deleting all images in the $HOME/.cache/darktable/mipmaps-xyz.d folder (where xyz denotes an alphanumeric identifier of the cache). After clearing the secondary cache you can simply allow darktable to re-generate thumbnails as needed, or you can generate all thumbnails in one go with darktable-generate-cache.\nIf you choose not to activate the disk backend and select too small a cache size, darktable may become unresponsive, you may experience continuous regeneration of thumbnails when you navigate your collection or flickering of thumbnail images. A good choice of cache size is 512MB or higher (see memory \u0026amp; performance tuning for more information).\nAll thumbnails are fully color managed. Colors are rendered accurately on screen as long as your system is properly set up to hand over the right monitor profile to darktable. For more information see the color management section.\n🔗skulls, question marks, and warning triangles If for some reason darktable is unable to generate a thumbnail, it displays one of three placeholder images to indicate the type of error preventing it from doing so.\nThere are three main reasons this could happen:\nMissing image file: If the file could not be found at the location recorded in the database, a skull will be displayed in place of the image. You are advised to remove images from the database using the actions on selection module before physically removing them from disk. Alternatively you may occasionally run the purge script from darktable\u0026rsquo;s toolset to clean-up your database.\nInvalid image format: While darktable will attempt to import all supported file extensions, the extension is not a guarantee that darktable will be able to interpret the file\u0026rsquo;s contents. If the file format (or an option within that format, such as compressed mode) is unsupported, darktable will display a question mark in place of the image. If the file appears to be corrupted, darktable will display a warning triangle in place of the image.\nLow memory: In the rare event that darktable runs out of memory while generating a thumbnail, it will warn you and display a skull. This can happen if darktable is run with sub-optimal settings, especially on a 32-bit system. See memory \u0026amp; performance tuning for more information.\n🔗thumbnail icons The following icons may be displayed over the top of thumbnails to provide additional information:\nImages that are members of a group are denoted by a light or dark group icon, where the darker icon identifies the lead image in that group.

A simple calculation makes this clear: For a 20 megapixel image, darktable requires a 4x32-bit floating point cell to store each pixel, meaning that each full image of this size will require approximately 300MB of memory just to store the image data. In order to actually process this image through a given module, darktable needs at least two buffers (input and output) of this size, with more complex modules potentially requiring several additional buffers for intermediate data. Without further optimization, anything between 600MB and 3GB of memory might be required to store and process image data as the pixelpipe executes. On top of this is darktable\u0026rsquo;s code segment, the code and data of any dynamically-linked system libraries, as well as further buffers that darktable uses to store intermediate states (cache) for quick access during interactive work.\nAll in all, darktable requires at least 4GB of physical RAM plus 4 to 8GB of additional swap space to run but it will perform better the more memory you have.\nAs well as executing on your CPU, many darktable modules also have OpenCL implementations that can take full advantage of the parallel processing offered by your graphics card (GPU). Similarly, the more GPU memory you have, the better darktable will perform.\n🔗tiling If darktable does not have sufficient memory to process the entire image in one go, modules may choose to use a \u0026ldquo;tiling strategy\u0026rdquo;, wherein the image is split into smaller parts (tiles) which are processed independently, and then stitched back together at the end. While this allows images to be processed with a much smaller memory footprint, it does also come with some down-sides:\ntiling is always slower \u0026ndash; sometimes up to 10x slower, though for some modules the difference is negligible, tiling is not technically possible for some modules because of the nature of the underlying algorithms For most systems, tiling will probably only be used for full-sized image exports, with interactive work in the darkroom being processed more efficiently. For best performance (and avoidance of tiling modes) you should run darktable alongside as few other applications as possible and configure darktable to use as much of your system and GPU memory as you can.\n🔗performance tuning There are a number of configuration parameters that can help you to fine-tune your system\u0026rsquo;s performance. Some of these parameters are available in preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; CPU / memory and others need to be modified directly in darktable\u0026rsquo;s configuration file (found in $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc).\nThis section provides some guidance on how to adjust these settings.\n🔗how to test In order to determine how much your modifications improve (or not) darktable\u0026rsquo;s performance, you will need one or more sample images to test with, and a method of assessing the speed of the pixelpipe.\nFor sample images, you are advised to use some of the more intensive modules, such as diffuse or sharpen or denoise (profiled). Exports are likely to have more consistent and comparable timings between pipe runs than interactive work (and will also push your hardware more).\nIn order to obtain profiling information you need to start darktable from a terminal with darktable -d opencl -d perf. If you want more information about tiling you should use darktable -d opencl -d tiling -d perf.\nEach time the pixelpipe is processed (when you change module parameters, zoom, pan, export etc.) you will see (in your terminal session) the total time spent in the pixelpipe and the time spent in each of the OpenCL kernels. The most reliable value is the total time spent in the pixelpipe and you should use this to assess your changes.\nNote: The timings given for each individual module are unreliable when running the OpenCL pixelpipe asynchronously (see asyncronous mode below).\nTo allow for efficient processing with OpenCL it is essential that the GPU is kept busy. Any interrupts or a stalled data flow will add to the total processing time. This is especially important for the small image buffers used during interactive work, which can be processed quickly by a fast GPU. However, even short-term stalls of the pixelpipe can easily become a bottleneck.\nOn the other hand darktable\u0026rsquo;s performance during file exports is more or less only governed by the speed of the algorithms and the horse-power of your GPU. Short-term stalls will not have a noticeable effect on the total time of an export.\n🔗darktable resources The \u0026ldquo;darktable resources\u0026rdquo; preference (in preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; CPU / memory) allows you to choose between four different approaches to allocating your system\u0026rsquo;s resources to darktable. Each of these options controls multiple individual parameters, which are defined independently in $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc. You can amend any of these directly within your darktablerc file to tweak values for your selected resource level, though you cannot add your own custom resource level to the preferences drop-down.\nEach of the four \u0026ldquo;darktable resources\u0026rdquo; options are defined as follows:\nresource_default=512 8 128 700 resource_large=700 16 128 900 resource_small=128 4 64 400 More generally, these can be represented as resource_level=a b c d where a - d are defined as follows:\na. system memory for module processing The maximum amount of system memory made available for module processing. Lower values force memory-hungry modules to process images with an increasing number of tiles. This number is a fraction of the total amount of system memory, divided by 1024. For example, on a system with 16GB of total system memory the amount assigned by resource_default (in GB) is 16 * 512 / 1024, or 8GB of system RAM. b. minimum tiling buffer size The minimum size of a single tiling buffer, similarly expressed as a fraction of total system memory. For example, on a system with 16GB of total system memory the amount assigned by resource_default (in GB) is 16 * 8 / 1024, or 0.125GB of system RAM. Note that this setting is largely historic and is no longer of much practical use \u0026ndash; you are advised to leave it at its default value. c. thumbnail cache memory The amount of memory to use for the thumbnail cache. Again, this is expressed as a fraction of total system memory and, on a 16GB system, the amount assigned by resource_default is 16 * 128 / 1024, or 2GB of system RAM. d. OpenCL (GPU) memory The maximum amount of GPU memory made available for module processing. As with system memory, lower values will force memory-hungry modules to process images with an increasing number of tiles. Your GPU memory will likely also be used by other applications on your system. However, in contrast to system memory, your GPU is not able to take advantage of swap files and it is impossible for darktable to know how much memory is available at a given time. If this parameter is set too high, darktable could be forced to fall back to CPU processing (which will be significantly slower but stable and with correctly processed data) or darktable might crash and even make your system unusable. For this reason, the GPU memory parameter fraction also includes an extra 600MB of headroom in an attempt to avoid over-allocation of memory. For example, on a GPU with 6GB of memory, darktable will use approximately (6 - 0.6) * 700 / 1024, or 3.5GB of GPU RAM when using the resource_default level. In addition to the resource levels presented in the UI the following options can be set via the command-line (e.g. darktable --conf resourcelevel=\u0026quot;notebook\u0026quot;). These modes are designed for debugging tiling issues and testing performance of common systems on larger development machines. The following options are provided:\n\u0026ldquo;mini\u0026rdquo; (1GB ram, 2MB single buffer, 128MB thumbnail cache, 200MB OpenCL memory) \u0026ldquo;notebook\u0026rdquo; (4GB ram, 32MB single buffer, 512MB thumbnail cache, 1GB OpenCL memory) \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; (8GB ram, 32MB single buffer, 512MB thumbnail cache, 2GB OpenCL memory) 🔗tuning GPU memory usage If you want to make maximal use of your GPU memory for OpenCL, you have three options:\nChoose the \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; resource level. For a 6GB card, this will use approximately 5GB of GPU memory, leaving 1GB for the rest of your system. (recommended) Alter darktablerc to increase the last number (the OpenCL memory fraction) for your selected resource level. For example, increasing the OpenCL memory fraction to 950 would increase the available memory on a 6GB GPU to approximately 5.3GB. (absolutely not recommended) Set preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; OpenCL \u0026gt; use all device memory to \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo;, which will use all of your device\u0026rsquo;s memory, less a 600MB headroom. Please see the section below for \u0026ldquo;per device setting\u0026rdquo; of headroom. 🔗balanced OpenCL versus CPU tiling In most cases, running a processing module on a high-powered GPU (the OpenCL codepath) is significantly faster than running the same module using the CPU codepath. However, many users have fast multi-core CPUs with a large amount of system RAM, but a GPU with significantly lower capabilities (typically, integrated graphics with small amounts of dedicated memory). Use of OpenCL code in these cases can lead to excessive tiling, and it is often better to run a module without tiling using the CPU codepath than to attempt to use OpenCL with heavy tiling.\nWhile processing the pipeline, darktable attempts to determine which mode will be best for a given module by estimating the expected workloads for both OpenCL and CPU codepaths. In most cases it will prefer the OpenCL codepath even if that would mean tiling the image, since OpenCL is typically much faster than running the CPU code (often as much as 10 times faster if it is a dedicated card).\nIf the ratio of estimated workloads (CPU vs GPU) is larger than the advantage hint (see below), darktable will use the CPU for processing that module, else it will use the GPU.\n🔗device-specific OpenCL configuration The default darktable settings deliver a reasonable GPU performance on most systems. However, if you want to try to optimize things further, this section describes the relevant configuration parameters (all of which are set in your darktablerc file).\nMost of the OpenCL-related options are managed with a \u0026ldquo;per device\u0026rdquo; strategy. The configuration parameter for each device looks like:\ncldevice_v5_nvidiacudaquadrortx4000=0 250 0 16 16 128 0 0 0.000 0.000 0.500\nor, more generally\ncldevice_version_canonicalname=a b c d e f g h i j k\nAn entry will be automatically created in darktablerc for each newly-detected device when you launch darktable for the first time, with the correct canonical device name and version number. The parameters a - k are defined as follows and can be manually edited:\na. avoid atomics 1 = avoid atomics; 0 = use atomics (default) Atomic operations in OpenCL are a special method of data synchronization and are only used in a few modules. Unfortunately, some old AMD/ATI devices are extremely slow in processing atomics and, on these cards, it is better to process the affected modules on the CPU rather than accepting an ultra-slow GPU codepath. Set this parameter to 1 if you experience slow processing within modules like shadows and highlights, monochrome, local contrast, or global tonemap (deprecated) or if you get intermittent system freezes. Please note that this should not affect any card manufactured since 2015. b. micro nap default 250 In an ideal case you will keep your GPU busy at 100% when processing the pixelpipe. However, if your GPU is also required to update your screen, and darktable is using it at 100%, there may not be sufficient time left for this task. This will usually manifest as jerky GUI updates on panning, zooming or when moving sliders. To resolve this issue darktable can add small pauses into its pixelpipe processing so that the GPU can catch its breath and perform GUI related activities. The \u0026ldquo;micro nap\u0026rdquo; parameter controls the duration of these pauses in microseconds. On all current systems you are safe with the default value. If you are using multiple devices or you are not using your discrete GPU for drawing on your screen, this value can be set to 0 for all non-desktop devices leading to improved performance.\nc. pinned memory 0 = disable pinned transfer (default); 1 = enforce pinned transfer During tiling huge amounts of memory need to be transferred between host and device. On some devices direct memory transfers to and from an arbitrary host memory region may give a large performance penalty. This is especially noticeable when exporting large images on smaller graphics cards or while using newer modules like diffuse or sharpen or the guided laplacians mode in the highlight reconstruction module. There is no safe method or general rule to predict whether or not this parameter will provide a performance benefit, so you will have to experiment for yourself. However, the chance of pinned transfer leading to an improvement is pretty low if your card was manufactured after 2015.\nd. clroundup wh / e. clroundup ht These parameters should be left at this default value \u0026ndash; testing has not shown any benefit to using other values. f. number of event handles default 128 Event handles are used by darktable to monitor the success/failure of kernels and provide profiling info even if the pixelpipe is executed asynchronously. The number of event handles is a limited resource of your OpenCL driver \u0026ndash; while they can be recycled, there is a limited number that can be used at the same time. Unfortunately, there is no way to find out what the resource limits are for a given device (this is due to darktable using the OpenCL V.1.2 API to support all platforms), so darktable uses a conservative guess of 128 by default. On most current devices and drivers you can expect a number of up to 1024 to be safe (for sure if your driver / card reports OpenCL V.2.0 or larger) leading to a slightly better OpenCL performance. If your driver runs out of free handles you will experience failing OpenCL kernels with error message CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES or even crashes or system freezes. (If you are running into this problem, please open a github issue) A value of 0 will block darktable from using any event handles. This will prevent darktable from properly monitoring the success of your OpenCL kernels but saves some driver overhead leading to a slightly better performance (less than 5%). The consequence is that all failures will lead to garbled output without darktable noticing. This is only recommended if you know for sure that your system runs rock-solid.\ng. asynchronous mode 1 = use asynchronous mode; 0 = don\u0026rsquo;t use (default) This flag controls how often darktable blocks the OpenCL pixelpipe to get a status on success/failure of the kernels that have been run. For optimum latency set this to 1, so that darktable runs the pixelpipe asynchronously and tries to use as few interrupts/events as possible. If you experience OpenCL errors like failing kernels, reset the parameter to 0. This will cause darktable to interrupt after each module so that you can more easily isolate any problems. Issues have been reported with some older AMD/ATI cards (like the HD57xx) which can produce garbled output if this parameter is set to 1. If in doubt, leave it at its default of 0. h. disable device 0 = enable device; 1 = disable device If darktable detects a malfunctioning device it will automatically mark it as such by setting this parameter to 1. If you have a device that reports a lot of errors you can manually disable it by setting this field to 1. If darktable has disabled the device but you are sure it should be used you can re-enable it by setting this field to 0. i. reserved\nj. advantage hint This defines the advantage hint described in the balanced OpenCL versus CPU tiling section. If you have a fast graphics card with plenty of memory you can safely leave this at its default value of 0.000. However, if you want to adapt this number to your own system, you should use the following process: Start darktable with the tiling debug option (darktable -d tiling) and start editing an image in the darkroom. Open the highlight reconstruction module and use the \u0026ldquo;guided laplacians\u0026rdquo; method, setting the \u0026ldquo;diameter of reconstruction\u0026rdquo; to a high value, while ensuring that tiling does not occur (check the debug information in your terminal session while adjusting the slider). Check the execution times of this module with OpenCL on and off (by running darktable -d perf to examine the performance). Set the \u0026ldquo;advantage hint option\u0026rdquo; to approximately (CPU execution time / GPU execution time). k. shared memory fraction Some OpenCL devices don\u0026rsquo;t have dedicated memory but share it with the CPU \u0026ndash; Apple ARM silicon is one example but also onboard devices from Intel, AMD or ARM SOCs. As we want to keep system memory available for caching or CPU codepaths we restrict the amount of all memory used to the given fraction. So with the default of 0.5 and an Apple computer with 16GB of system RAM, OpenCL would be able to make use of 8GB. Note: if darktable detects a \u0026ldquo;buggy\u0026rdquo; device configuration key it will be rewritten back to default values.\n🔗id-specific OpenCL configuration A second device-specific configuration key is also provided, which takes into account both the device name and the device id (in case you have two identical devices). In this case, the usual key name cldevice_version_canonicalname is followed by _idX with X being the device id. For example, if the above example device was referred to as device 0, the second configuration setting would (by default) be cldevice_v5_quadrortx4000_id0=600.\nThis configuration key currently only has a single parameter defined:\nforced headroom (default 600) The amount of memory (in MB) that will not be used by darktable during OpenCL processing. This setting is only valid if you set preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; OpenCL \u0026gt; use all device memory to \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo;. If you are certain that no apps (or your OS) make use of the specific device you can set this parameter to 0 for the otherwise-unused device so that darktable will use all of that device\u0026rsquo;s memory.\nThe default of 600MB should be fine for most systems. If you find you run into performance problems due to darktable falling back to CPU, try changing it to 800 or larger.\n🔗other configuration keys The following additional configuration keys are also available in darktablerc:\ncldevice_version_canonicalname_building This option is used when compiling OpenCL kernels and may be provided for performance tuning or to work around bugs. You must remove any existing kernels in order to recompile them with the new options. Provide an empty string to recompile without any options. Remove the setting entirely to recompile with default options, default is -cl-fast-relaxed-math for nvidia drivers, all other cards don\u0026rsquo;t have this compiler option set. The -cl-fast-relaxed-math option significantly improves performance but changes maths in the module\u0026rsquo;s processing code possibly leading to different results. For current Intel implementations this compiler flag leads to visibly wrong results, on AMD cards the results are non-conclusive. Some card/driver combinations are fine, some are not. As the AMD drivers constantly change we don\u0026rsquo;t recommend to use it on AMD cards. opencl_mandatory_timeout default 400 If darktable wants to make use of any OpenCL device it has to reserve it for further usage. If that device is current used darktable will wait up to opencl_mandatory_timeout * 5ms before it does a fallback to CPU. Increase this value if you would prefer to use OpenCL (because your card is really fast and your CPU is not).

For a given pixel, the final mask will have value of 0 if any of the individual masks are 0 at that location and it will only have a value of 1.0 if all masks have a value of 1.0 at that location.\nAny individual mask can exclude a pixel by setting its value to 0, regardless of what the other masks do. Once a pixel is excluded by a mask there is no way for another mask to include it again.\ninclusive Inclusive mode first inverts each individual mask (subtracts its value from 1.0), multiplies the inverted masks together, and finally inverts the combined mask once again. For a given pixel, the final mask will have a value of 1.0 if any of the individual masks are 1.0 at that location and it will only have a value of 0 if all masks have a value of 0 at that location.\nAny individual mask can include a pixel by setting its value to 1.0, regardless of what the other masks do. Once a pixel is fully included by a mask (its value is 1.0) there is no way for another mask to exclude it again.\nexclusive and inclusive inverted modes Using the above combination methods alone would still be rather limiting. We gain maximum flexibility by allowing an additional inversion step for each individual mask. This is governed by the polarity buttons that you find close to the individual channels. Toggling the polarity button of a mask inverts its values (subtracts the original value from 1.0).\nFinally within the “combine masks” combobox you may select the exclusive \u0026amp; inverted or inclusive \u0026amp; inverted options. Each of these options is equivalent to the exclusive and inclusive modes, respectively, but with a final step that inverts the resulting mask.\n🔗typical use cases inclusive mode For this mode you set the “combine masks” combobox to inclusive mode and make sure that all polarity buttons of all the individual channels and of the drawn mask are set to negative (-). Your starting point is a mask where all pixels have a value of zero (no pixel is selected). You now adjust the parametric mask sliders to bring more and more pixels into the selection or you draw shapes on the canvas to select specific areas of your image. exclusive mode In the opposite case you set the “combine masks” combobox to exclusive mode and make sure that all polarity buttons are set to positive (+). Your starting point is a mask with all values at 1.0 (all pixels are selected).

This needs more disk space but speeds up the lighttable view as it avoids the reprocessing of thumbnails (default on). enable disk backend for full preview cache If enabled, darktable writes full preview images to disk (.cache/darktable/) when evicted from the memory cache. Note that this can take a lot of storage (several gigabytes for 20k images) and darktable will never delete cached images. It\u0026rsquo;s safe to delete these manually if you want. Enabling this option will greatly improve lighttable performance when zooming an image in full preview mode (default off). enable smooth scrolling for lighttable thumbnails If enabled, use fractional scrolling when navigating through the thumbnails in the filemanager layout for a smoother experience.

You can also click and drag to change it. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to aim for the triangle or even the line \u0026ndash; you can click anywhere in the entire height of the slider, including the label. mouse wheel (adjust) Hover over the slider with your mouse, then use your mouse wheel to adjust the value. You can alter the default speed at which the mouse scroll adjusts a slider by scrolling over that slider while in visual shortcut mapping mode. keyboard arrow keys (adjust) When the slider has focus you can hover over the slider with your mouse, then use your keyboard\u0026rsquo;s arrow keys (←/↓ and →/↑) to adjust the value. In order to give focus to the widget without changing the current value you can right-click, then right-click again. right-click (pop-up edit) When your mouse is over a slider right-clicking enables a multi-functional pop-up below the slider for fine control with your mouse or numerical entry using the keyboard. A bent line extending from the triangular marker moves with your mouse. The closer your mouse pointer is to the triangular marker the coarser the control you have over the value; the further away from the triangular marker the finer your control. Left-click with your mouse to accept the new value and hide the pop-up.\nAlternatively you can type in a new value using your keyboard and commit by hitting the Enter key. You may even supply the new value in the form of an arithmetic expression which darktable will calculate for you \u0026ndash; the previous value is referenced as “x”.\nFor most sliders, the minimum and maximum values displayed are known as \u0026ldquo;soft limits\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; they do not represent the minimum/maximum values that you may enter, merely a suggested range of \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; values that most users will not need to exceed. As well as these soft limits, each slider also has \u0026ldquo;hard limits\u0026rdquo; which may not be exceeded.\nYou may right-click and type any value up to the hard limits for a given slider. For example, in the rotate and perspective module, the soft limits for angle are -10 to +10 degrees while the hard limits are -180 to +180 degrees; In the exposure module, the soft limits for the exposure slider are -3 to +4 EV while the hard limits are -18 to +18 EV. If you try to enter a value beyond the hard limit, it will be automatically be adjusted to the minimum/maximum allowable value.\ndouble-click (reset) Double-click on a slider or its label to reset back to the default value. Ctrl+double-click to reset its value back to any auto-applied preset (if one applies for the current image). If controls are grouped together within a tabbed interface, you can double-click on the tab\u0026rsquo;s header label to reset all settings in that tab. In addition, the speed of mouse-wheel, arrow-key and click+drag adjustments can be altered:\nhold down the Shift key while adjusting to increase the step size by a factor of 10. hold down the Ctrl key while adjusting to decrease the step size by a factor of 10. Both of these multipliers can be amended in preferences \u0026gt; shortcuts by altering the speed of the fallbacks/value actions.\n🔗comboboxes Click on a combobox to show a list of available options which you can click to select. Occasionally the selection list will open close to the bottom or top of the screen meaning that only some of the items are visible \u0026ndash; simply scroll with your mouse wheel to bring up the full list. Alternatively, you can also use the mouse wheel and keyboard arrow keys to select an option, or start typing to filter the combobox entries.\nAs with sliders, you can double-click the combobox or its label to reset back to the default value, or Ctrl+double-click to reset back to any auto-applied preset.\n🔗pickers Many modules allow parameters to be set using pickers (identified by the icon). Pickers allow you to select sample areas of the image from which to calculate values for module parameters. You can usually choose to select either a \u0026ldquo;point\u0026rdquo; (a single pixel) or an \u0026ldquo;area\u0026rdquo; (a rectangular selection of pixels) from the image, although some modules only allow one mode to be used.\nSelecting pixel(s) will cause the appropriate module value(s) to be updated, and may also cause additional visual feedback (for example, overlaying the range of selected pixels on a tone curve).\nActivate point mode by left-clicking the picker icon and then left-click anywhere on the image to select the pixel from which to calculate values. The selected point will be shown on-screen (with a cross icon) which you can adjust by left-clicking another pixel. Deactivate the picker by left-clicking the picker icon again.\nActivate area mode by either right-clicking or Ctrl+clicking the picker icon and then left-click and drag to select a rectangular area of the image from which to calculate values. The selected area will be shown on-screen as an overlaid rectangle which can be moved by either drawing another rectangle elsewhere or by left-clicking and dragging the corners of the drawn rectangle. Reset the rectangle (to select the whole image) by right-clicking anywhere on the image. Deactivate the picker by right-clicking (or Ctrl+clicking) the picker icon again.\nIn modules where only one mode is available, left-clicking the icon will usually toggle that mode on and off.\n🔗keyboard shortcuts Module parameters can also be adjusted using keyboard shortcuts.

We will look at it in a moment, but first let\u0026rsquo;s look at the code itself.\nWe know about require darktable. Here, we need to separately require darktable.debug which is an optional section of the API that provides helper functions to help debug lua scripts.\ndarktable.database is a table provided by the API that contains all images in the library database. Each entry in the database is an image object. Image objects are complex objects that allow you to manipulate your image in various ways (all documented in the types_dt_lua_image_t section of the API manual). To display our images, we use darktable.debug.dump which is a function that will take anything as its parameter and recursively dump its content.

Here, we are interested in the \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; label. This field is a boolean, and the documentation tells us that it can be written. We now just need to find all images with that field and print them out:\ndarktable = require \u0026#34;darktable\u0026#34; for _,v in ipairs(darktable.database) do if v.red then print(tostring(v)) end end This code should be quite simple to understand at this point, but it contains a few interesting aspects of lua that are worth highlighting:\nipairs is a standard lua function that will iterate through all numeric indices of a table. We use it here because darktable\u0026rsquo;s database has non-numeric indices which are functions to manipulate the database itself (adding or deleting images, for example).\nIterating through a table will return both the key and the value used. It is conventional in lua to use a variable named “_” to store values that we don\u0026rsquo;t care about.\nNote that we use the standard lua function tostring here and not the darktable-specific darktable.debug.dump. The standard function will return a name for the object whereas the debug function will print the content. The debug function would be too verbose here. Once again, it is a great debug tool but it should not be used for anything else.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/lua/printing-labeled-images/","tags":null,"title":"printing labeled images"},{"categories":null,"content":"The “reference values” tab determines the target values to which the source image must to be modified by the resulting style.

If this does not happen on your system by default, the easiest way to set them up and make sure all modules are loaded is by installing the nvidia-modprobe package.\nA user account that needs to make use of OpenCL from within darktable must have read/write access to NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s device special files. On some systems these files allow world read-write access by default, which avoids permission issues but might be debatable in terms of system security.

Whenever you import images, each image receives a default rating which you can define in the import module. You can also mark an image as “rejected”.\nThere are several ways to change a rating. While hovering the cursor over an image thumbnail, you can press a number key 0 – 5 to define the number of stars, or press R to “reject” an image.

You should see a nice message printed on the screen.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the code in detail. We first define a function that takes two strings as input parameters. The first one is the type of event triggered (\u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo;) and the second is the name of the shortcut (\u0026ldquo;A shortcut that prints its parameters\u0026rdquo;). The function itself calls darktable.print, which will print the message as an overlay in the main window.\nOnce that function is defined, we register it as a shortcut callback. To do that we call darktable.register_event which is a generic function for all types of events. We tell it that we are registering an event of type \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; with the name \u0026ldquo;hello shortcut\u0026rdquo;, then we give the callback to call and finally, we give the string to use to describe the shortcut in the preferences window.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try a shortcut that is a little more interactive. This one will look at the images the user is currently interested in (selected or moused-over) and increase their rating:\ndarktable = require \u0026#34;darktable\u0026#34; darktable.register_event(\u0026#34;increase rating\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;shortcut\u0026#34;, function(event,shortcut) local images = darktable.gui.action_images for _,v in pairs(images) do v.rating = v.rating + 1 end end,\u0026#34;Increase the rating of an image\u0026#34;) At this point, most of this code should be self explanatory. Just a couple of notes:\nInstead of declaring a function and referencing it, we declare it directly in the call to darktable.register_event this is strictly equivalent but slightly more compact.\nimage.rating is a field that gives the star rating of any image (between 0 and 5 stars, -1 means rejected).\ndarktable.gui.action_images is a table containing all the images of interest. darktable will act on selected images if any image is selected, and on the image under the mouse if no image is selected. This function makes it easy to follow darktable\u0026rsquo;s UI logic in lua.\nIf you select an image and press your shortcut a couple of times, it will work correctly at first but when you have reached five stars, darktable will start showing the following error on the console:\n\u0026lt;![CDATA[ LUA ERROR : rating too high : 6 stack traceback: [C]: in ?

These modules have some common features that warrant separate discussion.\n🔗nodes In their default state, curves are straight lines, defined by two anchor nodes at the top-right and bottom-left of the graph. You can move the nodes to modify the curve or generate new nodes by clicking on the curve. Ctrl+click to generate a new node at the x-location of the mouse pointer and the corresponding y-location of the current curve \u0026ndash; this adds a node without the risk of accidentally modifying the curve. Up to 20 nodes can be defined per curve. To remove a node, click on it and drag it out of the widget area.\n🔗curve controls The following controls are common to two or more of the above processing modules and are therefore discussed separately here. Please see the individual module documentation for discussion of any additional controls.\ninterpolation method tone curve and rgb curve only Interpolation is the process by which a continuous curve is derived from a few nodes. As this process is never perfect, several methods are offered that can alleviate some of the issues you may encounter.\ncubic spline is, arguably, the most visually pleasing. Since it gives smooth curves, the contrast in the image is better enhanced. However, this method is very sensitive to the nodes\u0026rsquo; position, and can produce cusps and oscillations when the nodes are too close to each other, or when there are too many of them. This method works best when there are only 4 to 5 nodes, evenly spaced. centripetal spline is designed specifically to avoid cusps and oscillations but, as a drawback, it will follow the nodes more loosely. It is very robust, no matter the number of nodes and their spacing, but will produce a more faded and dull contrast. monotonic spline is designed specifically to give a monotonic interpolation, meaning that there will be none of the oscillations the cubic spline may produce. This method is most suitable when you are trying to build an analytical function from a node interpolation (for example: exponential, logarithm, power, etc.). Such functions are provided as presets. It is a good trade-off between the two aforementioned methods. preserve colors If a non-linear tone curve is applied to each of the RGB channels individually, then the amount of tone adjustment applied to each color channel may be different, and this can cause hue shifts. The preserve colors combobox provides different methods of calculating the \u0026ldquo;luminance level\u0026rdquo; of a pixel in order to minimise these shifts. The amount of tone adjustment is calculated based on this luminance value, and then this same adjustment is applied to all three of the RGB channels. Different luminance estimators can affect the contrast in different parts of the image, depending on the characteristics of that image. The user can therefore choose the estimator that provides the best results for the given image. Some of these methods are discussed in detail in the preserve chrominance control in the filmic rgb module. The following options are available: none luminance max RGB average RGB sum RGB norm RGB basic power scale for graph tone curve and base curve only The scale allows you to distort the graph display so that certain graphical properties emerge to help you draw more useful curves. Note that the scaling option only affects the curve display, not the actual parameters stored by the module.\nBy default, a “linear” scale is used (scale factor 0), which uses evenly spaced horizontal and vertical axes. Positive values give the graph a logarithmic scale, compressing high values and dilating low values on both the horizontal and vertical axes, so that nodes in lowlights get more space on the graph and can be controlled more precisely.\nIncreasing the \u0026lsquo;scale for graph\u0026rsquo; slider sets the base of the logarithm used to scale the axes. This allows you to control the amount of compression/dilation operated by the scale. If you draw purely exponential or logarithmic functions from identity lines, setting this value defines the base of such functions.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/curves/","tags":null,"title":"curves"},{"categories":null,"content":"Control functionality in the darkroom view and associated modules.\n🔗general scroll down to increase mask parameters By default, scrolling your mouse up increases the value of the relevant shape parameters in drawn masks.

Both store visual information as a combination of primary colors (e.g. red, green and blue) which together describe a light emission to be recreated by a display.\nThe following image illustrates this concept.\nThe left-hand-side of the image depicts a colored light that we need to represent digitally. We can use three ideal color filters to decompose this light into three colored primary lights at different intensities. In order to recreate the original colored light from our ideal decomposition (as illustrated in the center of the image) we simply need to recombine those three primary lights by addition.\nIt should be possible to reproduce the original colored light by taking a set of white lights at the correct intensities and projecting those lights through appropriately colored filters. This experiment can be performed at home using gels and dimmable white bulbs. This is roughly what old color CRT displays did and is how video projectors still work.\nIn photography, the initial decomposition step is performed by the color filter array that sits on top of your camera\u0026rsquo;s sensor. This decomposition is not ideal, so it isn\u0026rsquo;t possible to precisely recreate the original emission with simple addition \u0026ndash; some intermediate scaling is required to adjust the three intensities.\nOn screens, the LED bulbs are dimmed proportionally to each intensity, and the emissions of the three lights are physically added to reconstruct the original emission. Digital images store the intensities of these primary lights as a set of three numbers for each pixel, depicted on the right-hand side of the above image as shades of gray.\nWhile a set of display intensities can be easily combined to recreate an original light on a screen (for example, if we created a synthetic image in-computer) the set of captured intensities from a sensor needs some scaling in order for the on-screen light addition to reasonably reproduce the original light emission. This means that every set of intensities, expressed as an RGB set, must be linked to a set of filters (or primary LED colors) that define a color space \u0026ndash; any RGB set only makes sense with reference to a color space.\nNot only do we need to temper the captured intensities to make them summable again, but if we are to recompose the original light on a display that does not have the same colored filters or primaries as the space in which our RGB set belongs, these intensities need to be rescaled to take into account the differing filters on the display. The mechanism for this scaling is described in color profiles, usually stored within .icc files.\nNote: Color is not a physical property of light \u0026ndash; it exists only in the human brain, as a product of the decomposition of a light emission by the cone cells in the retina, again very similar in principle to the above filtering example. An \u0026ldquo;RGB\u0026rdquo; value should be understood as \u0026ldquo;light emissions encoded on 3 channels connected to 3 primaries\u0026rdquo;, but the primaries themselves may look different from what humans would call \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;.\nThe filters described here are overlapping band-pass filters. Since they overlap, summing them back together would not preserve the energy of the original spectrum so (long story short) we need to dial them down with regard to the retina cone response\nMost of darktable\u0026rsquo;s actual image processing takes place in a large RGB \u0026ldquo;working profile\u0026rdquo; space, with some (mostly older) modules internally working in the CIELab 1976 color space (often just called “Lab”). The final output of the image processing pipeline is once again in an RGB space shaped for either the monitor display or the output file.\nThis process implies that the pixelpipe has two fixed color conversion steps: input color profile and output color profile. In addition there is the demosaic step for raw images, where the colors of each pixel are reconstructed by interpolation.\nEach module has a position in the pixelpipe that tells you which color space the module lives in:\nup to demosaic : The raw image information does not yet constitute an \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; but merely \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; about the light captured by the camera. Each pixel carries a single intensity for one primary color, and camera primaries are very different from primaries used in models of human vision. Bear in mind that some of the modules in this part of the pipe can also act on non-raw input images in RGB format (with full information on all three color channels).\nbetween demosaic and input color profile : Image is in RGB format within the color space of the specific camera or input file.\nbetween input color profile and output color profile : Image is in the color space defined by the selected working profile (linear Rec. 2020 RGB by default). As darktable processes images in 4x32-bit floating point buffers, we can handle large working color spaces without risking banding or tonal breaks.\nafter output color profile : Image is in RGB format as defined by the selected display or output ICC profile.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/special-topics/color-management/color-spaces/","tags":null,"title":"darktable's color spaces"},{"categories":null,"content":"Grouping images helps to improve the structure and clarity of your image collection when displayed in the lighttable view.\nYou can combine images into a group by selecting them and clicking the “group” button in the actions on selection module, or by pressing Ctrl+G. Likewise, you can remove selected images from a group by clicking the “ungroup” button, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.\nDuplicated images are automatically grouped together. Similarly, if you import multiple images from the same directory, having the same base name, but different extensions (eg. IMG_1234.CR2 and IMG_1234.JPG), those images automatically form a group.\nImages that are members of a group are denoted by a group icon in their thumbnails. Note that this icon is only shown when \u0026ldquo;overlays\u0026rdquo; are displayed on image thumbnails. Thumbnail overlays can be enabled by selecting the star icon in the top panel.\nThis icon also appears as a button, in the top panel of the lighttable view, that can be used to toggle grouping on and off. If grouping is off, all images are displayed as individual thumbnails. If grouping is on, the images in a group are represented by a single thumbnail image (the group leader). If you press the group icon in the group leader\u0026rsquo;s thumbnail, that group is expanded (click a second time to collapse). If you then expand another group, the first group collapses.\nAn expanded group in the filemanager mode of lighttable view is indicated by an orange frame that appears as soon as your mouse pointer hovers over one of the images. This frame surrounds all images in the group.\nYou can define which image is considered to be the group leader by clicking on the group icon of the desired image while that group is expanded. The group icon is shown only if grouping mode is enabled, so to change the group leader, you need to first enable grouping, expand the appropriate group and finally click the group icon of the desired \u0026ldquo;group leader\u0026rdquo; image. The current group leader is shown in a tooltip when you hover over the group icon of an image.\nIf you collapse an image group and then enter darkroom mode (e.g. by double-clicking on the thumbnail), the group leader image will be opened for developing.\nImage groups are also a convenient way to protect an existing history stack against unintentional changes. If you have just finalized an image and want to protect its current version, simply select the image, click “duplicate” in the actions on selection panel, and make sure that grouping is switched on and that the group is collapsed. Now, whenever you open the image group again in the darkroom, only the group leader will be altered. The underlying duplicate will remain unchanged.\nNote: “duplicating images” only generates a copy of an image\u0026rsquo;s history stack, stored in another small XMP file.

The smoothing is guided either by the module\u0026rsquo;s input or output (before blending), and may happen before or after the mask blurring, depending on what is selected in the “feathering guide” combobox. Feathering is particularly sensitive to the choice of guide image when used with edge-modifying modules (modules for sharpening or blurring an image). output before blur: feathering is guided using the output image of the module and takes place before the mask is blurred input before blur: feathering is guided using the input image of the module and takes place before the mask is blurred output after blur: feathering is guided using the output image of the module and takes place after the mask has been blurred input after blur: feathering is guided using the input image of the module and takes place after the mask has been blurred feathering radius Adjust the strength of the feathering effect. Feathering works best if the mask\u0026rsquo;s edges already approximately match some edges in the guiding image. The larger the “feathering radius” the better the feathering algorithm can align the mask to more distant edges. If this radius is too large, however, the feathered mask may overshoot (cover regions that the user wants to exclude). Feathering is disabled when the feathering radius is set to 0. blurring radius Blurring the mask creates a softer transition between blended and unblended parts of an image and can be used to avoid artifacts. The blurring radius slider controls the radius of a gaussian blur applied to the final blend mask. The higher the radius, the stronger the blur (set to 0 for an unblurred mask). Mask blur is always applied after feathering if both kinds of mask adjustment are activated. This allows any resulting sharp edges or artifacts to be smoothed. mask opacity The strength of the module\u0026rsquo;s effect is determined by the mask\u0026rsquo;s local opacity. Feathering and blurring the mask may reduce the opacity of the original mask. The “mask opacity” slider allows you to readjust the mask opacity to compensate. If the mask opacity is decreased (negative slider values) less opaque parts are affected more strongly. Conversely, if the mask opacity is increased (positive slider values) more opaque parts are affected more strongly. As a consequence, completely opaque portions of the mask always remain opaque and completely transparent portions always remain transparent. This is to ensure that regions that have been fully excluded from or included in a module\u0026rsquo;s effect (by setting the mask\u0026rsquo;s opacity to 0% or 100%) remain fully excluded or included. mask contrast This slider increases or decreases the mask contrast. This allows you to adjust the transition between the opaque and transparent parts of the mask. temporarily switch off mask Sometimes it is useful to visualize a module\u0026rsquo;s effect without the mask being active. Click on this icon to temporarily deactivate the mask (the selected blend mode and global opacity remain in effect). display mask Click on this icon to display the current mask as a yellow overlay over a black-and-white version of the image. Solid yellow indicates an opacity of 100%; a fully visible gray background image (without yellow overlay) indicates an opacity of 0%. 🔗example: feathering a drawn mask It can be rather tedious to create a drawn mask that precisely covers a particular feature in an image. In this example, we want to enhance the color contrast of the lion sculpture shown in the left image above without affecting the background.\nThe first image above shows the original, unaltered image. The second image shows a rough selection of the sculpture created with a drawn mask. Note that the mask is rather fuzzy and does not precisely follow the outline of the lion sculpture. The third image shows the effect of adjusting the feathering radius, mask opacity and mask contrast, leading to a well matched mask with little effort. In this example the feathering radius has been adjusted to 50 and a blur radius of 5 was chosen to smooth the mask to some degree. The mask opacity and mask contrast have been increased to 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. The final image above shows the end result, where the color enhancement (via the color contrast module) is restricted to only the lion sculpture. Mask feathering works particularly well in this example because the sculpture is well separated from the out-of-focus background. The distinct edge at the border of the sculpture guides the feathering mask adjustment to match the shape of the sculpture.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/refinement-controls/","tags":null,"title":"mask refinement \u0026 additional controls"},{"categories":null,"content":"darktable will detect OpenCL run-time errors automatically. On detecting an error, it will then reprocess everything on the CPU. While this will slow down processing it should not affect the end result.\nThere can be various reasons why OpenCL might fail during the initialization phase. OpenCL depends on hardware requirements and on the presence of certain drivers and libraries. In addition all these have to fit in terms of maker, model and revision number. If anything does not fit (e.g. your graphics driver \u0026ndash; loaded as a kernel module \u0026ndash; does not match the version of your libOpenCL.so) OpenCL support will likely not be available.\nIn this case, the best thing to do is start darktable from a console with darktable -d opencl.\nThis will give additional debugging output about the initialization and use of OpenCL. First, if you find a line that starts with [opencl_init] FINALLY ... that should tell you whether OpenCL support is available for you or not. If initialization failed, look at the messages above for anything that reads like could not be detected or could not be created. Check if there is a hint about where it failed.\nHere are a few cases that have been observed in the past:\ndarktable states that no OpenCL aware graphics card is detected or that the available memory on your GPU is too low and the device is discarded. In that case you might need to buy a new card if you really want OpenCL support.\ndarktable finds your libOpenCL.so but then tell you that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t get a platform. NVIDIA drivers will often give error code -1001 in this case. This happens because libOpenCL.so is only a wrapper library. For the real work further vendor-specific libraries need to be loaded. This has failed for some reason. There is a structure of files in /etc/OpenCL on your system that libOpenCL.so consults to find these libraries. See if you can find something fishy in there and try to fix it. Often the required libraries cannot be found by your system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic loader. Giving full path names might help.\ndarktable states that a context could not be created. This often indicates a version mismatch between the loaded graphics driver and libOpenCL. Check if you have left-over kernel modules or graphics libraries from an older installation and take appropriate action. When in doubt, perform a clean reinstall of your graphics driver. Sometimes, immediately after a driver update, the loaded kernel driver does not match the newly installed libraries. In this case reboot your system before trying again.\ndarktable crashes during startup. This can happen if your OpenCL setup is completely broken or if your driver/library contains a severe bug. If you can\u0026rsquo;t fix it, you can still use darktable with option --disable-opencl, which will skip the entire OpenCL initialization step.\ndarktable fails to compile its OpenCL source files at run-time. In this case you will see a number of error messages looking like typical compiler errors. This could indicate an incompatibility between your OpenCL implementation and darktable\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of the standard. In that case please raise an issue on github and we will try to assist. Please also report if you see significant differences between CPU and GPU processing of an image.\nyou have installed a number of OpenCL drivers meant for the same hardware, this will always lead to severe problems and must strictly be avoided. On Windows systems you often have the Microsoft OpenCLon12 driver installed via the OpenCL Compatibility Pack. Inspect and check at preferences \u0026gt; processing \u0026gt; OpenCL.\nA few emulated-on-CPU implementations of OpenCL also exist, coming as drivers provided by INTEL or AMD.

After decomposing an image in this way, a module can limit its processing to one or more of these detail layers, and then piece the layers back together again at the end to form its output. This allows us to be surgical about which features in the image we wish to impact when working with a module.\nSome of the operations that darktable can perform in this way are:\nnoise removal (in the denoise (profiled), raw denoise and contrast equalizer modules) contrast adjustment (in the contrast equalizer module) blurring or removal of unwanted detail (in the retouch module) 🔗theory A wavelet is an oscillating mathematical function that starts and ends at zero. The following diagram shows some simple wavelets of differing sizes.\nThese wavelet functions are used to scan and decompose an image using a mathematical operation called convolution. This picks out details from the image that are on a similar scale to the size of a given wavelet, and builds a number of these detail layers, each corresponding to a different wavelet scale.\nThe following is an example where detail layers have been extracted from the above image. In this case, the images were produced using the retouch module, splitting the image into 8 different layers, and using the module\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;display wavelet scale\u0026rdquo; button to visualise each of the detail layers:\nThe bars in the wavelet decompose section indicate the layers that have been extracted at different wavelet scales. The darkest rectangle at the left represents the entire image (before decomposition) and the gray boxes each represent one of the decomposed layers. Clicking on the staircase icon below the bar graph enables the layer visualization overlay so that you can see what the currently selected layer looks like.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at some of the layers generated for the above image.\nAt scale #2, the image contains only very fine details, including the model\u0026rsquo;s eyebrows, eye lashes and the pores of his skin. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t include the coarser details of the image, because those details have been extracted to other layers:\nAt scales #5 and #6 we begin to see larger and larger features:\nBy scale #8 we only see very high-level features such as the overall shape of the model\u0026rsquo;s nose, eye and cheek:\n🔗why use wavelets? Suppose, in the above example, that we wanted to smooth out some of the blotchiness in the model\u0026rsquo;s skin, without losing any of the underlying small-scale texture. Wavelet decomposition makes this a trivial operation - we can simply use the retouch module to apply a Gaussian blur to only the \u0026lsquo;blotchy\u0026rsquo; detail layer(s), leaving all other layers untouched. Once the adjustment is complete, the retouch module simply recombines the adjusted layer with the remaining untouched layers to produce the final image.\nThe sequence of images below shows (1) The original image; (2) The layer (scale 5) that we wish to blur; and (3) The final image after the scale 5 layer has been blurred and the layers recombined:\nAs you can see, the large-scale skin blotches have been removed, but the small-scale details remain untouched.\n🔗interacting with wavelet scales There are two methods by which processing modules allow you to modify their operation using wavelet scales.\n🔗wavelet decomposition As discussed above, the retouch module allows you to choose how many detail levels to split your image into. It decomposes the image into separate layers and allows you to perform operations selectively on each individual layer or on the image as a whole:\nSee the retouch module documentation for more details.\n🔗spline controls The denoise (profiled), raw denoise and contrast equalizer modules allow their effects to be applied more or less to each wavelet scale using splines.\nHere, each node in the graph represents a different level of detail in the image, from coarse detail on the left to fine detail on the right. You can raise or lower each of these nodes with your mouse to increase or decrease the module\u0026rsquo;s effect, respectively, on that wavelet scale.\nTo modify the curve, click slightly above or below the line near to a node and drag up or down. You can change the width of your modification by scrolling with your mouse wheel, which increases or reduces the size of the circle displayed under your mouse pointer. A small circle indicates that the effect of dragging the curve up or down will be isolated mostly to the node being adjusted. A larger circle indicates that the effect will be more broad and will increasingly impact adjacent nodes. When you hover your mouse over the graph, shaded areas indicate the parts of the spline that will be impacted when you attempt to modify the curve.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/wavelets/","tags":null,"title":"wavelets"},{"categories":null,"content":"The darktable team regularly reviews old modules and updates their implementation where issues are found or updated science means that they can be improved.

These fields are reused when we read the value of the preference. The string field tells the lua engine that the preference is a string. It could also be an integer, a filename or any of the types detailed in the API manual relating to types_lua_pref_type. We then have the label for the preference in the preference menu, the tooltip when hovering over the value and a default value.\ndarktable.register_storage is the call that actually registers a new storage type. The first argument is a name for the storage type, the second is the label that will be displayed in the UI and last is a function to call on each image. This function has a lot of parameters, but filename is the only one we use in this example.

It goes beyond the scope of this manual to explain the details of how to take this photo, but in a nutshell you need to make the shot on a sunny day around midday with the light source (the sun) shining at an angle onto the card. You need to avoid any glare in the image. The neutral white color patch in the gray ramp (G00) should end up at the L value specified in the description of your card. Often this is L=92 and requires you to overexpose the shot by about 1/3 EV. Ideally you will make several shots with slightly different exposures and later select the right one in darktable. Make sure that the chart fills up most of the frame. Use a lens with a “normal” focal length (e.g. 50mm equivalent) and stop down a bit to avoid vignetting.\nYou then open the raw file in darktable and disable most modules, especially base curve. Select the standard input matrix in the input color profile module and disable gamut clipping. Select “camera white balance” in the white balance module.\nThere is a special situation if your camera automatically applies some lens corrections (namely vignetting correction) to the resulting JPEG file. In this case you need to activate the lens correction module in darktable so that raw processing matches the JPEG in this respect. However, since darktable\u0026rsquo;s vignetting correction may not exactly match the in-camera correction, it is better to disable this correction in-camera if possible.\nTo output your image go to the export module in the lighttable.\nYou will need to select “Lab” as the output color profile.

For example, images encoded on 8 bits can only contain values from 0 to 255, images on 10 bits from 0 to 1023, and so on… Graphic standards postulate that the maximum of that range, no matter its actual value, will always represent the maximum brightness that the display medium is able to render, usually between 100 and 160 Cd/m² (or nits) depending on the actual standard. We generally call this maximum \u0026ldquo;100 % display-referred\u0026rdquo;. The minimum of the range, encoded 0 no matter the bit-depth used, becomes then \u0026ldquo;0 % display-referred\u0026rdquo;. 100 % encodes pure white, 0 % encodes pure black.\nThis is a limitation for image processing applications, because it means that any pixel lying outside of this range will be clipped to the nearest bound, resulting in non-recoverable loss of data (colors and/or textures).\nFor the longest time, image processing software too was bounded to this limitation for technical reasons, and some still is, but now by design choice. As a result, they would clip RGB intensities at 100 % display-referred between image operations.\ndarktable uses floating-point arithmetic inside its color pipeline, which means it can handle any RGB value internally, even those outside the display-referred range, as long as it is positive. Only at the very end of the pipeline, before the image is saved to a file or sent to display, are the RGB values clipped if needed.\nPixels that can take values outside of the display range are said to have “unbounded colors”. One could choose to clamp (i.e. confine) those values to the allowed range at every processing step or choose to carry on with them, and clamp them only at the last step in the pipeline. However, it has been found that processing is less prone to artifacts if the unbounded colors are not clamped but treated just like any other color data.\nAt the end of the pipeline, modules like filmic rgb can help you to remap RGB values to the display-referred range while maximizing the data preservation and avoiding hard clipping, which is usually not visually pleasing.\nHowever, at all times in the pipeline, you must ensure that you do not create negative RGB values. RGB intensities encode light emissions and negative light does not exist. Those modules that rely on a physical understanding of light to process pixels will fail if they encounter a non-physical light emission. For safety, negative RGB values are still clipped whenever they might make the algorithms fail, but the visual result might look degraded. Negative values can be produced when abusing the black level in exposure or the offset in color balance and care should be taken when using these modules.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/special-topics/color-management/unbounded-colors/","tags":null,"title":"unbounded colors"},{"categories":null,"content":"darktable supports variable substitution in a number of modules and preference settings.

In particular the use of a preference for the export path wasn\u0026rsquo;t very nice. We can do better than that by adding elements to the user interface in the export dialog.\nUI elements are created via the darktable.new_widget function. This function takes a type of widget as a parameter and returns a new object corresponding to that widget. You can then set various fields in that widget to set its parameters. You will then use that object as a parameter to various functions that will add it to the darktable UI. The following simple example adds a lib in the lighttable view with a simple label:\ndarktable = require \u0026#34;darktable\u0026#34; local my_label = darktable.new_widget(\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;) my_label.label = \u0026#34;Hello, world !\u0026#34; darktable.register_lib(\u0026#34;test\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;test\u0026#34;,false,false,{ [darktable.gui.views.lighttable] = {\u0026#34;DT_UI_CONTAINER_PANEL_LEFT_CENTER\u0026#34;,20}, },my_label) There is a nice syntactic trick to make UI elements code easier to read and write.

If you are engaged in stage photography you should pay close attention to such lights appearing in images.\nIn order to mitigate this issue the input color profile module has a gamut clipping option. This option is switched off by default but can be activated if artifacts are observed. Depending on the settings, colors will be confined to one of the available RGB gamuts. In effect black pixel artifacts are prevented at the costs of losing some color dynamics.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/special-topics/color-management/color-artifacts/","tags":null,"title":"possible color artifacts"},{"categories":null,"content":"Control how images are processed.\n🔗image processing always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines.

If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this parameter\u0026rsquo;s value (default off).\npixel interpolator (warp) The pixel interpolator used for rotation, lens correction, liquify, crop and final scaling. Whenever we scale or distort an image we have to choose a pixel interpolation algorithm (see wikipedia for details). For warping modules, darktable offers bilinear, bicubic or lanczos2. In general, bicubic is a safe option for most cases and is the default value.\npixel interpolator (scaling) The pixel interpolator used for scaling. The same options are provided as for the warp modules, but with the addition of lanczos3. lanczos3 can cause pixel overshoots leading to artifacts but sometimes gives a more crisp visual appearance. This option is therefore only provided for transforming (scaling) algorithms and is the default value.\nLUT 3D root folder Define the root folder (and sub-folders) containing LUT files used by the LUT 3D module. Raster mask files root folder Define the root folder (and sub-folders) containing raster mask files used by the external-raster-mask module. auto-apply pixel workflow defaults Choose which modules and module order are applied to new RAW image edits by default: scene-referred (filmic) assumes that most processing will be performed in a linear RGB color space. Selecting this option automatically enables the filmic rgb, exposure and color calibration modules for new edits and sets the module order to v3.0 RAW.\nThe exposure module includes an automatic exposure adjustment of +0.7 EV (to provide a midtone brightening comparable to the +0.5 to +1.2 EV typically added by in-camera tone curves), and automatically enables the \u0026ldquo;compensate camera exposure\u0026rdquo; option for the filmic workflow. Both of these settings are intended to provide a reasonable starting-point for RAWs produced by a broad range of SLR and mirrorless cameras, but they can be overridden with an automatically-applied preset if the defaults produce consistently dark images for your camera.\nIn the scene-referred workflows, the color calibration module acts in conjunction with the white balance module as the modern way to handle white balance and chromatic adaptation with improved color science. Note that when using the color calibration module, the white balance module needs to be active and set to \u0026ldquo;Camera Reference\u0026rdquo; mode (this will be done automatically and warnings will appear if the two modules have inconsistent settings). When using both modules as prescribed, it is still possible to auto-detect white-balance from a specific area of the image by selecting the CCT picker tool in the CAT tab of color calibration.\nscene-referred (AgX) follows the same assumptions and overall flow as scene-referred (filmic), with the exception that it auto-enables the AgX module for tone mapping in place of filmic rgb.\nscene-referred (sigmoid) (default) also follows the same assumptions and overall flow as scene-referred (filmic), with the exception that it auto-enables the sigmoid module for tone mapping in place of filmic rgb.\ndisplay-referred (legacy) is the legacy mode (used by default in darktable 2.6 and earlier) and assumes that most processing will be performed in the Lab color space. Selecting this option automatically enables the base curve module for tone mapping and sets the module order to legacy. This workflow uses only the white balance module for chromatic adaptation.\nnone sets the module order to v3.0 RAW and uses the white balance module for chromatic adaptation. No other exposure or tone mapping modules are enabled by default.\nauto-apply per camera basecurve presets Use a per-camera base curve by default (if available) instead of the generic manufacturer one.

The analysis is based on the preview image embedded within the imported file. This makes for a more convenient workflow when working with monochrome images, but it slows down the import, so this setting is disabled by default. show warning messages Enable this option to display warning messages in processing modules where non-standard and possibly harmful settings have been used in the pipeline. Such messages can sometimes be false-positives (because of intentional non-standard settings) and can be disregarded if you know what you are doing. Disable to hide these warnings. (default on). 🔗CPU / memory darktable resources Choose how much of your system and graphics card (GPU) memory will be used by darktable. Four options are provided by default: small takes roughly 20% of your system memory and 40% of your GPU memory. This might be acceptable on very large systems, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not exporting images. Mostly, though, this can only be recommended if you are using a lot of other demanding applications at the same time as darktable. default takes roughly 60% of your system memory and 70% of your GPU memory. This mode is recommended if you\u0026rsquo;re not exporting a lot of images, have at least 16Gb of system memory and 4Gb of GPU memory, and also are running a lot of other application at the same time as darktable. large takes roughly 75% of your system memory and 90% of your GPU memory. This is the best option if you are only using darktable on your system and/or are exporting a lot of images. See the memory \u0026amp; performance tuning section for more information.\n🔗OpenCL activate OpenCL support Your GPU can be used by darktable to significantly speed up processing. The OpenCL interface requires suitable hardware and matching OpenCL drivers on your system. If one of those is not found this option is grayed out. OpenCL support can be switched on and off at any time and takes immediate effect (default on). OpenCL scheduling profile Defines how preview and full pixelpipe tasks are scheduled on OpenCL enabled systems: default: the GPU processes the center view pixelpipe; the CPU processes the preview pipe. very fast GPU: both pixelpipes are processed sequentially on the GPU. multiple GPUs: both pixelpipes are processed in parallel on different GPUs \u0026ndash; see the multiple devices section for more information. OpenCL drivers In most cases darktable is able to find the correct OpenCL driver but this depends on how your operating system handles installation. Generally speaking, darktable must: not use unreliable drivers only have one active driver per hardware device. Problems are typically found where the vendor-provided driver is installed as well as another driver (like rusticl) or (on Windows) where the OpenCLon12 driver has been installed via the OpenCL Compatibility Pack. Toggle-switches are offered for most available drivers, though on more exotic hardware like ARM boards you will have to enable the \u0026ldquo;other platforms\u0026rdquo; fallback option. Select the drivers you want to use from the list.

In color science, each of these terms has a precise meaning.\nThere are two frameworks within which color properties may be analyzed and described:\nA scene-linear, physiological, framework, that mostly focuses on the response of the retina cone cells, using color spaces such as CIE XYZ 1931 or CIE LMS 2006, A perceptual, psychological, framework that stacks the brain\u0026rsquo;s corrections on top of the retina signal, using color spaces such as CIE Lab 1976, CIE Luv 1976, CIE CAM 2016 and JzAzBz (2017). These two frameworks provide us with metrics and dimensions to analyze color and allow us to change some of its properties while preserving others.\nThe following dimensions of color are used by darktable:\nhue An attribute of visual perception in which an area appears to be similar to one of the colors red, yellow, green, or blue, or to a combination of adjacent pairs of these colors considered in a closed ring. 1 Hue is a shared property between the perceptual and scene-linear frameworks. luminance The density of luminous intensity with respect to a projected area in a specified direction at a specified point on a real or imaginary surface. 2 Luminance is a property of scene-referred frameworks, and is expressed by the Y channel of the CIE XYZ 1931 space. brightness An attribute of visual perception according to which an area appears to emit, transmit or reflect more or less light. 3 lightness The brightness of an area judged relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears to be white or highly transmitting. 4 Lightness is the perceptual, non-linear homologue of luminance (roughly equal to the cubic root of luminance Y). Lightness is expressed by the L channel in CIE Lab and Luv 1976 and the J channel in JzAzBz. chroma The colorfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears gray, white or highly transmitting. 5 Warning: chroma is not short for chrominance, which is the color part of a video signal (the Cb and Cr channels in YCbCr, for example). brilliance The brightness of an area judged relative to the brightness of its surroundings. 6 saturation The colorfulness of an area judged in proportion to its brightness. 7 purity The distance of the pixel chromaticity from the white point in the xy chromaticity plane. Zero purity means the light is achromatic. High purity, at the other extreme, means the light is laser-like, composed of a single wavelength. Colors can be described in many different color spaces, but no matter the color space, each color needs at least 3 components: some metric of luminance or brightness, and 2 metrics of chromaticity (hue and chroma, or opponent color coordinates).\n🔗illustrations While the previous definitions are useful to give a meaning to the words, they don\u0026rsquo;t tell us what we should be looking at. The following charts show luminance, lightness, chroma, brilliance/brightness and saturation varying from a \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; base color and how the resulting colors degrade:\n(Lightness + Chroma) or (Brilliance/Brightness + Saturation) are two different ways to encode the same reality. They are orthogonal spaces that can be converted from one to another by a simple rotation of the base. This means that chroma evolves at constant lightness, saturation evolves at constant brilliance/brightness, and vice versa:\nLines of equal chroma are vertical (following the patches grid), meaning that chroma has the same direction for all colors in the gamut (see below). However, lines of equal saturation are oblique (drawn dashed on the graph) and all go from black through each color patch, meaning that their directions are particular to each color.\nIncreasing the chroma will therefore move all colors uniformly away from the central gray axis horizontally, while increasing the saturation will close or open the angle of the oblique dashed lines like a flower.\nSimilarly, increasing the lightness will move all colors uniformly up from the horizontal axis, while increasing brilliance/brightness will move them along the lines of equal saturation.\nOn both of the above charts, lightness, chroma, saturation and brilliance are drawn in the JzAzBz color space, which is a perceptual color space suited for an HDR signal, and is used in parametric masks and the color balance RGB module. Luminance is drawn in the CIE XYZ 1931 color space, and represents the effect of an exposure compensation. It shows the same behaviour as brilliance, except that the step size is not perceptually scaled.\nNote: In this section, brilliance and brightness are both used to describe the same dimension. In all rigor, brightness is an absolute metric, whereas brilliance is the brightness of some surface relative to the brightness of its surroundings (that is, how much a surface \u0026ldquo;pops\u0026rdquo; out of its surroundings and looks fluorescent). But in image editing, increasing the brightness of some surface will indeed increase its brilliance too, so the term brilliance is preferred in darktable\u0026rsquo;s user interface for clarity and in reference to its visual effect.\n🔗color dimensions and gamut The gamut is the volume of colors that a certain color space can encompass and encode. It is important to note that, once converted to perceptual spaces, the gamut of any RGB space is not uniform along hues.\nThe following examples show the gamut volume of the sRGB space on hue slices containing the primary red, green and blue lights of the sRGB space, over a lightness-chroma plane with a uniform scale:\nThis shows that increasing the chroma (displacement over the horizontal axis) of some quantity can be safe for some hues at some lightness, but can push other hue-lightness coordinates way out of gamut. For example, we have much more margin in green or magenta than in cyan.\nMany gamut issues at export are actually user-induced and the result of harsh chroma enlarging. For that reason, using brightness-saturation color models may be safer.\n🔗color dimensions and complementary colors Cyan, magenta, yellow (CMY) are complementary colors of red, green, blue (RGB). However, the complementary CMY spaces computed from RGB spaces are not perceptually complementary. To show this, we create a CMY space from sRGB, where cyan has sRGB coordinates (0, 1, 1), magenta (1, 0, 1) and yellow (1, 1, 0), and display it in a lightness-chroma space:\nBy comparing with the hue slices of the primary colors in the previous section, it is easy to see not only that the gamuts don\u0026rsquo;t have the same shapes, but that the colors do not match.\nThis is one more reason to avoid using HSL/HSV spaces (derived from RGB spaces) to perform color editing: since these RGB spaces are not perceptually uniform in the first place, the resulting HSV/HSL spaces are not uniform either. While RGB spaces have some merit based on their connection to physical light, any process involving hue should go directly to perceptual spaces.\n🔗color dimensions and settings Many applications, including darktable, call any settings that affect chroma \u0026ldquo;saturation\u0026rdquo; (for example, in color balance, \u0026ldquo;contrast/brightness/saturation\u0026rdquo;). This is a symptom of software trying to be accessible to non-professionals by using a common language. This is misleading, since saturation does exist and is quite different from chroma. In addition, many video specifications improperly call chroma \u0026ldquo;saturation\u0026rdquo;. Whenever darktable reuses such specifications, it uses the incorrect term from the specification rather than the proper color dimension term.\nCIE definition of hue: https://cie.co.at/eilvterm/17-22-067\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCIE definition of luminance: https://cie.co.at/eilvterm/17-21-050\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCIE definition of lightness: https://cie.co.at/eilvterm/17-22-059\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCIE definition of brightness: https://cie.co.at/eilvterm/17-22-063\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCIE definition of chroma: https://cie.co.at/eilvterm/17-22-074\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nArticle about brilliance (paywall): https://doi.org/10.1002/col.20128\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCIE definition of saturation: https://cie.co.at/eilvterm/17-22-073\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/special-topics/color-management/color-dimensions/","tags":null,"title":"darktable's color dimensions"},{"categories":null,"content":"Most image processing applications come from the 1990s and/or inherit a 1990s workflow. These applications processed images encoded with 8 bit unsigned integers because it was more memory- and computationally-efficient. However, due to the use of an integer format (which implies rounding errors) they had to apply a \u0026ldquo;gamma\u0026rdquo; (essentially a transfer function applying a power 1/2.2 or 1/2.4 to encode the RGB values) and increase the bit-depth in the low-lights in order to reduce rounding errors there (humans are very sensitive to low-light details). The 8 bit integer formats are also technically limited to the 0-255 range. Anything outside of this range overflows and is clipped to the nearest bound.\nThese workflows, using bounded RGB representations and possibly non-linear transforms to encode RGB signals, are called \u0026ldquo;display-referred\u0026rdquo;. They rely on the assumption that the image has been prepared for display at an early stage in the processing pipeline, and embed hard-coded assumptions about the RGB values of black, middle-gray and white. Most of the image-processing algorithms used in these workflows have been tuned around these assumptions. For example, the overlay blending mode expects a middle-gray encoded at 50% (or 128 in integer encoding).\nUnfortunately the non-linear scaling, which is mandatory to make the integer encoding work, breaks the natural relationships between pixel values. Hue and saturation change in unpredictable ways, and value relationships between neighbouring pixels are dilated or compressed such that gradients are also altered unpredictably.\nDisplay-referred pipelines therefore break optical filters (lens blurring or deblurring), alpha compositing (which relies on optical and geometrical definitions of occlusion), colors and gradients (local relationships between chrominance and luminance of pixels). They also don\u0026rsquo;t scale well to HDR images, which led to the development of many questionable local and global tonemapping methods and the infamous 2010s \u0026ldquo;HDR look\u0026rdquo;.\nModern computers are not tied to the same computational limitations as those from the 1990s, and can work on pixels whose values are completely unbounded (from 0 up to +infinity) and encoded as real numbers (using floating point formats). These possibilities enable what we call a \u0026ldquo;scene-referred\u0026rdquo; workflow, in which pixels can retain their original radiometric relationships along almost the entire processing pipe. In scene-referred workflow, pixels are prepared for display only at the last stage of the pipeline, in the display transform. This means that the RGB values of the pixels are kept proportional to the intensity of the light emission recorded by the camera on the scene, enabling accurate alpha compositing and optical filter emulations, while also scaling to any dynamic range through the same algorithm (SDR as well as HDR).\nHowever, scene-referred pipelines lose the convenient fixed values of white, middle-gray and black which characterised display-referred pipelines, and setting these values, according to the scene and to the conditions of shooting, now becomes the responsibility of the user. This requires a more complex user interface.\nAlso, because scene-referred values are supposed to be physically-meaningful, pixels cannot have zero intensity. This would mean they have no light at all, and the existence of zero light breaks many physically-accurate algorithms. In fact, white and black mean nothing with regard to the original scene, which is only a collection of luminances at varying intensities. The scene-referred workflow simply aims at remapping some arbitrary scene luminances to what will appear white or black on the output medium.\nVersions of darktable prior to 2.6 had a non-linear display-referred pipeline, assuming that a non-linear transform took place early in the pipe and middle-gray was thereafter encoded as 50%. However, not all modules and filters clipped pixel values above 100%, leaving open the possibility of recovering those values later in the pipe.\nThe filmic module\u0026rsquo;s view transform, introduced in darktable 2.6, was the first step toward a scene-referred pipeline, and deferred the mandatory, non-linear, display preparation to the end of the pipe, along with the ability to set custom black, gray and white values. The color balance module then introduced a way to deal with a variable definition of middle-gray.\nStarting in darktable 3.2, users could choose between two workflows that defined consistent default settings, modules and pipeline order for both display-referred and scene-referred processing.\nIn darktable 3.4, a full scene-referred masking and blending option was introduced, allowing masks to be defined for pixel values above 100% and using only unbounded blending operators.\nSwitching to scene-referred is a cognitive leap for most experienced users, who are used thinking in display-referred ways. In a display-referred workflow, it is customary to anchor the white value and let tone adjustments revolve around that point, trying to maximize brightness while avoiding clipping. In a scene-referred workflow, white and black values are fluid and adapted to the output medium. It is advised that users anchor middle-gray (which will be preserved as-is for any output medium) and let the view transform (filmic) dilate or contract the dynamic range around that point. Because 10 bit HDR white is 4 times as bright as 8 bit SDR white, any rigid definition of \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; becomes irrelevant. But anchoring for middle-gray is actually more convenient, since it keeps the average brightness of the image unchanged through the view transform.\nSome modules (levels, rgb levels, tone curve, rgb curve) are inherently incompatible with a scene-referred workflow, because their graphical interface implicitly suggests RGB values that are bounded within the 0-100% range. While the pixel operations they perform can be used in either scene-referred or display-referred workflows because they are unbounded internally, their controlling interface does not allow pixels to be selected outside of the 0-100% range.\nSimilarly, blending modes such as overlay, linear light, soft light, hard light, darken, brighten, etc. all have hard-coded thresholds that internally expect display-referred non-linear encoding.\nIn darktable 3.4 and above, hovering the cursor over a module header shows a tooltip detailing the color spaces, ranges and encodings that the module expects, uses and produces. Here are the definitions of the terms used:\nlinear Pixel values are proportional to the scene radiometric emission, in a way that enables accurate emulation of physical filters. non-linear Pixel values are re-scaled such that low-lights are given a larger encoding range, usually to remap the 18.45% reference middle-gray to a value between 46 and 50%. display-referred Pixel values are expected to lie between 0 and 100% of the display range, where 100% is understood to be the luminance of a 20% reflective white surface (the white patch of a Color Checker) and 0% is understood to be the maximum density of the output medium (saturated black ink or minimum LED panel backlighting). scene-referred Pixel values are expected to be greater than zero up to +infinity. The meaning of specific pixel values needs to be defined at runtime by the user. Scene-referred values don\u0026rsquo;t automatically imply a linear, radiometrically scaled, encoding.

Such devices commonly feature sets of keys/buttons and sometimes encoders (knobs/rotors) and faders (sliders). Buttons sometimes feature lights, which makes them ideal for toggling features in darktable, because the lights can reflect the current (on/off) status. Encoders and faders are ideal for use with on-screen sliders in processing modules. They can be \u0026ldquo;endless\u0026rdquo; (without a start/end point and without any markings on the knob) allowing greater than 360 degrees rotation, and they may be motorized. This is helpful when switching between images or points in the editing history since the \u0026ldquo;physical\u0026rdquo; position of the encoders/faders always corresponds to the on-screen position. You may also find a ring of LEDs around an encoder that indicates its current value.\n🔗endless encoders; absolute / relative encoding Besides their physical features, these devices are often highly configurable in how they send data. Encoders can send their \u0026ldquo;absolute\u0026rdquo; position when they are turned, as a value in the range 0-127. Darktable will send back the current position of the on-screen slider, which a ring of LEDs would show (if present) or a motorized fader would respond to (by moving the knob). If the encoder is endless, it can also be used at different speeds and higher resolution than just the 128 steps, with either many rotations or less than a full rotation required to move the on-screen slider between extremes.\nEndless encoders without ring lights might send relative movements which can be accelerated when turning quickly. Different encoding modes can be used, and the device might come with software to configure these options. It is important that all encoders use the same settings and send on the same \u0026ldquo;channel\u0026rdquo; as the keys (ideally the first: 0 or 1). By default darktable tries to figure out which channel and encoding is used by listening to the first five messages. After starting a session you should slowly turn a knob left/down so that 5 identical one-step-down messages are sent. If this fails the input system can be reset (by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+i) for another try. On success, a toast message will be shown in the middle of the screen displaying the discovered encoding mode \u0026ndash; 127 (\u0026ldquo;2s Complement\u0026rdquo;) and 63 (\u0026ldquo;Relative Offset\u0026rdquo;) are common.\n🔗usage If your device has been successfully configured and connected, you should see messages like \u0026ldquo;G#\u0026ndash;1 (8) not assigned\u0026rdquo; when you press a button (the first is a musical notation code for the \u0026ldquo;tone\u0026rdquo;, the second a numerical representation) or \u0026ldquo;CC1,up not assigned\u0026rdquo; when adjusting an encoder. You are now ready to assign buttons and encoders to actions. The easiest way to do this for a bunch of them in one go is to press the visual shortcut mapping button (to the left of the preferences button) to enter shortcut visual mapping mode. In this mode, when you hover the mouse over a button or slider, if you then press a key or turn an encoder on the MIDI device, it gets assigned as a shortcut to that widget. You can immediately test it (while staying in mapping mode) by moving the mouse to the middle of the screen (so you don’t accidentally assign it to a different widget) and then repeating the action. Right-click to switch off mapping mode.\nYou might also want to assign buttons to duplicate the Ctrl and Shift key functions. For this, you need the full shortcuts dialog (right-click on the shortcuts button or open preferences and go to the shortcuts tab). In the top (\u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo;) list, double-click on \u0026ldquo;global/modifiers\u0026rdquo;. Now press the MIDI button you want to assign to Shift. Double click on \u0026ldquo;global/modifiers\u0026rdquo; again, but this time after assigning a button change the element for the newly created shortcut in the bottom list from \u0026ldquo;shift\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;ctrl\u0026rdquo;. Now you can use your MIDI device together with your mouse to access most of the functionality in darktable. After ticking \u0026ldquo;enable fallbacks\u0026rdquo; in the shortcuts dialog, holding Ctrl while turning an encoder will slow it down by a factor 10, whereas holding Shift speeds it up.\nSeveral devices produced by Behringer have LEDs in a circle around their encoder knobs. These use different patterns depending on what slider or combobox they are assigned to:\nIf the slider goes from -1 to +1, only the middle LED will be lit at zero. Moving negative will gradually light up the left side, moving positive will light the right side. If the slider goes from 0-100%, you’ll see more LEDs coming on when moving right, until they are all lit at 100%. Other numeric values will use 1 or 2 LEDs to indicate intermediate values. Dropdowns will use 1 LED for the options that fit on the first turn of the dial and 2 on the second turn. 🔗troubleshooting and configuration If you don’t see any \u0026ldquo;not assigned\u0026rdquo; toast at the top of your screen when pressing keys or turning knobs, you’ll want to test if any other MIDI applications can see the device. Under Linux you’ll need to have Alsa installed. After plugging in the device, dmesg should show lines like these:\nusb 1-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using xhci_hcd ... mc: Linux media interface: v0.10 usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio Darktable uses the simple cross-platform layer PortMidi to access the underlying OS API (Alsa, Core Midi, WinMM). If you are self-compiling, make sure you have included this library.\nStarting darktable with the debug parameters -d input will give additional information. It should try to open up to 10 MIDI devices in the order it finds them. On the command line you might see something like this:\n[midi_open_devices] opened midi device \u0026#39;Arturia BeatStep\u0026#39; via \u0026#39;MMSystem\u0026#39; as midi0 [midi_open_devices] opened midi device \u0026#39;BCR2000\u0026#39; via \u0026#39;MMSystem\u0026#39; as midi1 [midi_open_devices] opened midi device \u0026#39;X-TOUCH MINI\u0026#39; via \u0026#39;MMSystem\u0026#39; as midi2 Two issues can arise:\na device you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use might be opened anyway (and potentially cause inappropriate behavior, like starting a fireworks show prematurely \u0026ndash; see this document); or devices might appear in a different order at the next startup (for example because they are plugged into a different usb port). Since configurations are stored with the device number only, reordering would cause an incorrect layout to be picked up. You can fix which devices to load in a specific location and which ones to skip using the configuration parameter preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous \u0026gt; interface \u0026gt; order or exclude midi devices. To skip loading the BCR2000 in the above example and to fix the other two devices into the number 0 and 2 slots, you could set this config parameter to \u0026ldquo;BeatStep,dontuse,X-TOUCH,-BCR2000\u0026rdquo;. This would leave the BeatStep as device midi0, always leave midi1 unused and would not load the BCR2000 at all, but if any other devices are connected, they would appear as midi3, midi4 and so on. Adding \u0026ldquo;,-\u0026rdquo; at the end would prevent any further devices loading.\nIf you just specify the configuration parameter as a single minus sign \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo;, no devices will be loaded at all.\nFor devices that use relative encoding as mentioned above, you’d have to perform the slow-turn-left procedure on every start-up, or add the found encoding to the configuration string. For example \u0026ldquo;Loupedeck:127\u0026rdquo;.\nSome MIDI controllers have keys with a light beneath them. These can be used to toggle settings and show the current position by having the light on or off. For this to work, darktable checks periodically (a few times a second) whether, say, the position of an on-screen toggle button has been changed, and sends messages to any linked MIDI device buttons to switch their light on or off. But if an unknown device has unintentionally been connected, this could be undesirable. So by default darktable waits until a \u0026ldquo;note\u0026rdquo; message is received from a MIDI button before sending any \u0026ldquo;note\u0026rdquo; light on/off messages back for that (and any lower numbered) button. That way no more buttons are addressed than exist on the device. If you immediately want all button lights to be used (rather than having to press the highest note once for each session) you can specify the number of buttons in the \u0026ldquo;order or exclude MIDI devices\u0026rdquo; preference, for example, \u0026ldquo;BeatStep:63:16\u0026rdquo;.\n🔗devices reported to be working The shortcut mapping system has been most extensively tested with the Behringer devices and contains custom code to deal with their specific features. All other devices are treated as \u0026ldquo;generic midi\u0026rdquo; and may or may not work (well). If you succeed in getting a MIDI device up and running that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been mentioned below, it would be greatly appreciated if you would provide feedback in order to assist others, if any special steps are required. You could do this either by submitting a documentation pull request to amend this page or by filing an issue containing the necessary information.\n🔗Behringer X-touch Mini / Compact These devices should be in Standard Mode (not MC). Layers A \u0026amp; B are somewhat supported, however, since the device does not send a notification when switching between layers, and since lights (both under buttons and the pattern used around the rotors) are set based on which layer darktable believes is active, everything will only be updated completely after you press or turn something in the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; layer. Default settings are assumed; if any have been changed they can be restored using this X-Touch Editor\n🔗Behringer BCR2000 / BCF2000 These machines are highly configurable so there are many settings that could complicate the interaction with darktable\u0026rsquo;s MIDI module. The BC Manager tool (available for Windows and MacOS) can be used to configure them. The easiest thing to do is to reset all encoders and buttons to their simplest settings, which can be done (for the BCR2000) using this file. You can send it to the machine with BC Manager or (under Linux) with amidi. There\u0026rsquo;s also a global setting called \u0026ldquo;Deadtime\u0026rdquo; that determines how long the BCR ignores arriving messages after sending out updates. This is to avoid feedback loops, but for darktable it means that it blocks the adjustments sent back immediately after each rotor move. So Deadtime needs to be set to 0.\n🔗Arturia Beatstep Individual rotors can be configured to send absolute (0-127) values or changes (+/- 1,2,3,\u0026hellip; in different encodings). The recommended setting is Relative #1 for all knobs with Knob Acceleration set to Slow (Off) or Medium. Then put the string BeatStep:63:16 in preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous \u0026gt; interface \u0026gt; order or exclude midi devices. This can be configured with Midi Control Center, available for Windows or MacOS.\n🔗Loupedeck / Loupedeck+ Put the string Loupedeck:127 in \u0026ldquo;preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous \u0026gt; interface \u0026gt; order or exclude midi devices\u0026rdquo;.\n@jenshannoschwalm has provided a layout that can be imported in the shortcuts dialog/tab.

However, if your system is equipped with more than one GPU, you might want to set the relative device priority manually. To do this you need to select the “default” scheduling profile and change the settings in the “opencl_device_priority” configuration parameter.\nIt is important to understand how darktable uses OpenCL devices. Each processing sequence of an image \u0026ndash; to convert an input to the final output using a history stack \u0026ndash; is run in a pixelpipe. There are five different types of pixelpipe in darktable. One type is responsible for processing the center image view (or full view) in darkroom mode, another pixelpipe processes the preview image (navigation window, also required for histograms and more internal stuff relevant for correct output of the full view). Another preview pixelpipe would be required for showing a second darkroom window. There can be one of each of these three pixelpipes running at any time, with the full and preview pixelpipes running in parallel. In addition there can be multiple parallel pixelpipes performing file exports as well as multiple parallel pixelpipes generating thumbnails. If an OpenCL device is available, darktable dynamically allocates it to one specific pixelpipe for one run and releases it afterwards.\nThe computational demand varies significantly depending on the type of pixelpipe being executed. The preview image and thumbnails are low resolution and can be processed quickly, whereas processing the center image view or the second window is more demanding. A full export pixelpipe is more demanding still.\nThe configuration parameter “opencl_device_priority” holds a string with the following structure:\na,b,c.../d,e,f.../g,h,i.../j,k,l.../m,n,o...\nEach letter represents one specific OpenCL device. There are five fields in the parameter string separated by a slash, each representing one type of pixelpipe. a,b,c... defines the devices that are allowed to process the center image (full) pixelpipe. Likewise devices d,e,f... can process the preview pixelpipe, devices g,h,i... the export pixelpipes, devices j,k,l... the thumbnail pixelpipes and finally devices m,n,o... preview pixelpipe for the second window. An empty field means that no OpenCL device may serve this type of pixelpipe.\ndarktable has an internal numbering system, whereby the first available OpenCL device receives the number 0. All further devices are numbered consecutively. This number, together with the device name, is displayed when you start darktable with darktable -d opencl. You can specify a device either by number or by its canonical name (upper/lower case and whitespace do not matter). If you have more than one device with the same name you need to use the device numbers in order to differentiate them.\nA device specifier can be prefixed with an exclamation mark !, in which case the device is excluded from processing a given pixelpipe. You can also use an asterisk * as a wildcard, representing all devices not previously explicitly mentioned in that group.\nSequence order within a group matters \u0026ndash; darktable will read the list from left to right and whenever it tries to allocate an OpenCL device to a pixelpipe it will scan the devices in that order, taking the first free device it finds.\nIf a pixelpipe process is about to be started and all GPUs in the corresponding group are busy, darktable automatically processes the image on the CPU by default. You can enforce GPU processing by prefixing the list of allowed GPUs with a plus sign +. In this case darktable will not use the CPU but rather suspend processing until the next permitted OpenCL device is available.\ndarktable\u0026rsquo;s default setting for “opencl_device_priority” is */!0,*/*/*/!0,*.\nAny detected OpenCL device is permitted to process the center view image. The first OpenCL device (0) is not permitted to process both preview pixelpipes. As a consequence, if there is only one GPU available on your system, the preview pixelpipes will always be processed on the CPU, keeping your single GPU exclusively for the more demanding center image view. This is a reasonable setting for most systems. No such restrictions apply to export and thumbnail pixelpipes.\nThe default is a good choice if you have only one device. If you have several devices it forms a reasonable starting point. However, as your devices might have quite different levels of processing power, it makes sense to invest some time optimizing your priority list.\nHere is an example. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we have a system with two devices, a fast Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and a slower GeForce GTX 1050. darktable (started with darktable -d opencl) will report the following devices:\n[opencl_init] successfully initialized. [opencl_init] here are the internal numbers and names of OpenCL devices available to darktable: [opencl_init] 0 \u0026#39;NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050\u0026#39; [opencl_init] 1 \u0026#39;NVIDIA CUDA Quadro RTX 4000\u0026#39; [opencl_init] FINALLY: opencl is AVAILABLE on this system. with the canonical names shown above as nvidiagforcegtx1050 and nvidiacudaquadrortx4000\nHere, the GeForce GTX 1050 is detected as the first device and the Quadro RTX 4000 as the second. This order will normally not change unless the hardware or driver configuration is modified, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to use device names rather than numbers to be on the safe side.\nAs the GTX 1050 is slower than the RTX 4000, an optimized \u0026ldquo;opencl_device_priority\u0026rdquo; could look like:\n!nvidiagforcegtx1050,*/!nvidiacudaquadrortx4000,*/nvidiacudaquadrortx4000,*/nvidiacudaquadrortx4000,*/!nvidiacudaquadrortx4000.\nThe GTX 1050 is explicitly excluded from processing the center image pixelpipe; this is reserved to “all” other devices (i.e. the RTX 4000). Conversely \u0026ndash; for the preview pixelpipes \u0026ndash; the RTX 4000, so that only the GTX 1050 is permitted to do the work.\nFor file export and thumbnail generation we want all hands on deck. However, darktable should first check whether the RTX 4000 device is free, because it\u0026rsquo;s faster. If it is not free, then all other devices \u0026ndash; in fact only the GTX 1050 \u0026ndash; are checked.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/special-topics/opencl/multiple-devices/","tags":null,"title":"multiple devices"},{"categories":null,"content":"As has been mentioned, OpenCL systems come with a huge variety of setups: different GPU manufacturers and models, varying amounts of GPU memory, different drivers, different distributions etc..\nMany of the potential problems will only appear with very specific combinations of these factors.

There is not much we can do if we are unable to reproduce your issue.\nIf you are having issues with a specific device (and you have other OpenCL devices available) the first thing to do would be to try disabling just that device \u0026ndash; see memory \u0026amp; performance tuning for more information.\nIf nothing else helps, the best option is probably to start darktable with\ndarktable --disable-opencl\nIn the end there is nothing in darktable that only runs on GPU.

In the popup, it is possible to create a new workspace, delete workspaces or to work from memory (no database). A workspace is a combination of a library database and a darktablerc configuration file using the same shared configuration folder settings (data database and shortcuts). See darktable invocation for more details around library.db, data.db and darktablerc. (default off) create database snapshot Specifies how often darktable should create database snapshots. Options are \u0026ldquo;never\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;once a month\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;once a week\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;once a day\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;on close\u0026rdquo; (default \u0026ldquo;once a week\u0026rdquo;) how many snapshots to keep Number of snapshots to keep after creating a new snapshot, not counting database backups taken when moving between darktable versions. Enter \u0026ldquo;-1\u0026rdquo; to store an unlimited number of snapshots. (default 10) 🔗XMP sidecar files create XMP files XMP sidecar files provide a redundant method of saving the changes that you have made to an image, in addition to the changes saved to darktable\u0026rsquo;s database. This option allows you to choose when files will first be written. Once written, they will subsequently be updated each time you edit or add a tag to the image. Choose from: never: Don\u0026rsquo;t write sidecar files. This can be useful if you are running multiple version of darktable for development/testing purposes but is not normally recommended, on import: A sidecar file will be written as soon as you add an image to darktable\u0026rsquo;s library, after edit: A sidecar will not be written until the first time you edit or add a tag to an image. It\u0026rsquo;s strongly recommended that you choose either \u0026ldquo;on import\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;after edit\u0026rdquo;. Sidecar files provide a useful fail-safe to prevent data loss if your database becomes corrupted. Backing up your raw file plus the accompanying sidecar file will allow you to fully restore your work at a later date by re-importing your edit history back into darktable (default \u0026ldquo;on import\u0026rdquo;).\nstore XMP tags in compressed format Entries in XMP tags can get rather large and may exceed the available space to store the history stack in some output files on export. This option allows binary XMP tags to be compressed in order to save space. Available options are “never”, “always”, and “only large entries” (default). auto-save interval This preference sets the interval (in seconds) after which the processing history for an image will be automatically saved (while in the darkroom view). Set to zero to disable auto-saving. Note that this option might be ignored for slow drives (default 10s). look for updated XMP files on startup Scan all XMP files on startup and check if any have been updated in the meantime by some other software. If updated XMP files are found, a menu is opened for the user to choose which of the XMP files to reload (replacing darktable\u0026rsquo;s database entries by the XMP file contents) and which of the XMP to overwrite from darktable\u0026rsquo;s database. Activating this option also causes darktable to check for text sidecar files that have been added after import time (default off).

It can be a tedious, frustrating and unexciting task, so darktable includes functionality to help make it faster and more reliable.\n🔗preparation 🔗shooting color checkers Shooting a color checker on-location can save a tremendous amount of time during batch post-processing of a series of images. The image of the color checker can be quickly used as a color reference in the post-processing workflow to neutralize any color cast \u0026ndash; Datacolor and X-Rite color checkers (24 and 48) are natively supported.\n🔗prefer consistent lighting conditions If possible, use controlled artificial lighting to maintain consistent lighting over the series of images. This means that you won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about light color temperature and intensity changes between images. Shoot a new image of the same color checker every time your lighting conditions change.\n🔗prefer manual mode If possible, shooting in manual mode with constant exposure settings will help to remove some variability in the series. In terms of post-processing, any variation means that individual adjustments will be needed on each image, which will hinder your productivity.\n🔗post-processing 🔗concepts The post-processing needs to be split in 2 fully separated parts:\nprimary color-grading, secondary color-grading. Primary color-grading is performed first in the pixel pipeline and in the editing workflow, with modules such as exposure, input color profile and color calibration. Its purpose is to normalize each image to the same neutral ground-truth, in terms of overall brightness, color accuracy and white balance. This stage aims at making all images look similarly boring by removing any color cast and ensuring a perfectly neutral white, and is particularly important if your series uses different cameras. Primary color-grading is not about artistic intent or expression, but simply about preparing a sane and consistent basis for the next stage.\nSecondary color-grading happens next in the pixel pipeline and in the editing workflow. This is where all the artistic expression happens, with modules such as color balance rgb. If and only if the primary color-grading was successful at perfectly neutralizing all images to the same ground-truth, copying and pasting the secondary color-grading steps between images should have exactly the same visual effect on each image, no matter if the images were shot with a different camera or under slightly different lighting conditions.\nIn a nutshell, the whole purpose of the primary color-grading is to ensure the repeatability of the secondary color-grading between images. For example, if a non-neutral white balance is expected in the series, it is much easier to re-introduce non-neutrality in color balance rgb (using the same color shift) on fully-neutralized images, than to fine-tune the primary color-grading individually on each image, especially if several different cameras were used.\n🔗method 🔗profiling the series You will first need to extract a color calibration profile from the image(s) of your color checker. This profile can then be applied to all images shot under the same lighting conditions with the same camera by copying and pasting the development history stack in the lighttable view. This step needs to be repeated for each camera and lighting setup.\nNote: this process only works with the modern chromatic adaptation workflow, which assumes hard-setting the white balance to a D65 (camera reference) illuminant. See the documentation in the color calibration module for more information.\n🔗editing the reference image Choose a reference image that was taken in the lighting conditions closest to those of the color checker image that served as your profiling reference. Your primary color-grading should already be handled by the profile used in the color calibration module (in conjunction with the input color profile module). What remains to complete this stage is to adjust the exposure setting to match the overall brightness that you expect.\nNext, proceed with the filmic rgb white and black relative exposures, as well as the contrast setting. Finish with the secondary color-grading.\nWhen this is done, you can measure the brightness and chromaticity of a control sample, preferably located on a non-moving surface that is consistently lit across your series (and appearing in all the frames). These measurements are taken using the area exposure mapping and color calibration area mapping tools. They will be memorized and will serve as a target for individual images as needed.\n🔗propagating the look You can then propagate your secondary color-grading (including filmic rgb) to all the other images of the series, no matter whether or not they were shot in the same lighting conditions, since you should already have propagated your primary color-grading (calibration profile) to the relevant images. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to paste the history using append mode or you will overwrite your primary color-grading as well.\nHowever, this alone will not ensure a consistent look for the whole series.\n🔗fine-tune individual settings If there was some variability in your lighting conditions, each image will need some further fine-tuning adjustments. Fortunately, if you have applied the proposed method so far, this should be relatively straightforward.\nFirst, homogenize the exposure using your control sample and the area exposure mapping tool.\nThen, adjust the filmic rgb white relative exposure if needed, preferably using the picker. The contrast should not require any adjustment since it does not depend on the dynamic-range of the image.\nFinally, homogenize the chromatic adaptation, using your control sample and the color calibration area mapping tool.\nThis should get you close enough in most cases. However, if the background has changed, it is possible that these fine adjustments (aimed towards technically normalizing the primary color-grading on an individual basis) are not sufficient to give a perceptually-even look. In this case, you will need an extra step of secondary color-grading, which you are advised to perform on top of the previous one (shared with the other images of the series), in new instances of the relevant modules located later in the pipe. This ensures that the base secondary color-grading stays constant for all images and makes for a better workflow. You are not advised to make large changes in the primary color-grading to manage perceptual discrepancies involving contrast with the background.\n🔗controlling your series The culling mode in the lighttable view will help you to compare images side-by-side when the work is done. To view your reference edit in the darkroom view, you may display the filmstrip and increase its height, or use a snapshot of the reference overlaid on the current image (which will not necessarily have the same size).\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/guides-tutorials/batch-editing/","tags":null,"title":"batch-editing images"},{"categories":null,"content":"darktable\u0026rsquo;s Lua API is documented in its own manual with a detailed description of all data structures and functions.

They allow you to perform actions without interacting directly with a UI element.\nAn action is usually an operation that you might undertake using darktable\u0026rsquo;s point-and-click user interface. See common actions for a list of the most common ones. For example:\nIncrease, decrease or reset sliders Scroll through dropdown lists Enable, expand or focus modules Click buttons Switch between views The recommended way to assign shortcuts to visual elements is the visual shortcut mapping mode.\n🔗in a nutshell If you just want to assign a specific key to toggle a button, the process is the following:\nClick on the icon in the top panel Hover the button that you want to control Press the key that you want to use to control the button Similarly, to control a slider with a shortcut you can:\nClick on the icon Hover the slider that you want to control Press the key that you want to use to control the slider, and scroll the mouse wheel or move the mouse horizontally, vertically or diagonally The system is very flexible and powerful, and this is just scratching the surface. Keep on reading to understand it better and learn how to make the most of it.\n🔗types of shortcuts and actions There are two types of actions:\nDiscrete actions E.g., executing a command, focusing a UI element or resetting a slider Directional actions E.g., adjusting the value of a slider or scrolling through a list of presets As the two action types are inherently different, so are the shortcuts you can use to trigger them:\nDiscrete actions can be triggered by discrete shortcuts consisting only of key presses and optionally mouse clicks Directional actions need also a direction (and, in the case of sliders, a magnitude). Hence, the corresponding directional shortcuts will also incorporate a mouse movement For example:\nThe key e can be used to focus a module, or to toggle it on/off The key e, combined with up/down movements or the mouse, can be used to control the value of a slider Note: A directional shortcut is sufficient to trigger a discrete action. The opposite is not true. However, it is possible to use a combination of two discrete shortcuts to control a directional action. For example, you can use two different shortcuts to trigger the up and down effects of a slider (see anatomy of an action).\nIf you are using keyboard and mouse, all shortcuts must start with one or more key presses, as mouse actions in isolation are used to navigate and interact with the UI.\nIf you have an input device, you can trigger discrete actions by pressing one or more buttons on the controller. Directional actions can use a combination of buttons and a knob/joystick movement, or just knob/joystick movement.\n🔗anatomy of a shortcut The simplest shortcut consists of just one key press (e.g., e).\nThe same key can be repeated up to three times, so also e double-press (i.e., e pressed and released twice in quick succession) and e triple-press (i.e., e pressed and released three times in quick succession) are valid, and distinct, shortcuts.\nYou can further extend a shortcut with up to three clicks of different mouse buttons. So, e double-press + left click or e + right click + left click are also valid shortcuts.\nFinally, if your fingers are very nimble and you really need to go there, you can repeat the last click up to three times. So, also e + left click + middle double-click and e double press + middle click + left click + right triple-click are valid shortcuts.\nHence, the most complex shortcut can consist of 8 key/button presses:\nThree key presses of the same key, (e.g., e), followed by Three presses of the three mouse buttons, followed by 2 more repetitions of the last click. Your shortcut can include one or more modifiers (shift, ctrl and alt). In this case, for a directional shortcut, both the last key and the modifier must be pressed down when you execute the movement. For example, ctrl + e double-press + pan means that while moving the mouse left and/or right both e and ctrl must be pressed down.\nNote: If you are a macOS user, your shortcuts will use cmd instead of ctrl and option instead of alt.\nIf you are defining a directional shortcut, then the movement part of the shortcut must be executed while the last key, mouse or controller button is held down.\nFor example, the shortcut e double-press + pan, can be activated by pressing e twice, holding down e on the second press and moving the mouse horizontally while the key is pressed.\n🔗short and long presses By default, all key presses and button clicks in a shortcut are short, i.e., the key/button is pressed and immediately released. However, the last repetition of a key/button press in a shortcut can also be a long one. You can turn a normal key/button press into a long press by simply holding it a little longer before releasing it (longer than double-click speed but shorter than twice double-click speed). This applies to key presses and mouse clicks alike. Hence e double-press and e long double-press are two distinct shortcuts that can be assigned to different actions. The associated action triggers when the key is released, which entails that a shortcut ending with a long press cannot be used for a directional shortcut.\n🔗movements in directional shortcuts The following movements are supported when defining directional shortcuts:\nMovement of the mouse scroll wheel Horizontal, vertical or diagonal movement of the mouse cursor Movement of a knob/joystick on an input device When using an input device, you can directly assign a control knob or joystick to an action. However, this will significantly reduce the flexibility of such devices, as you will be able to use the knob/joystick only to control one action. By prefixing the movement with a key or button press you can use the same knob/joystick to control multiple actions.\n🔗triggering multiple shortcuts at once If both e + scroll and f + scroll are mapped to a slider (or if you have fallbacks enabled), then scrolling the mouse wheel while holding down both e and f will move both sliders. Similarly, you could map e double-press + scroll and f double-press + scroll to two nodes in a graph (say, yellow and green in color equalizer). You can then move both sliders at once by:\npressing and releasing e once; pressing and holding e; pressing and holding f; using the scroll wheel while both e and f are pressed. This works because the repeat key counter is per-shortcut, not per key, and it is reset only after the current shortcut ends (i.e., when the repeated key is released). Thus it is possible to trigger as many actions at once as your fingers can handle, provided that all the shortcuts involved have the same number of key presses (i.e., single, double or triple presses).\n🔗shortcuts must be unique within a view A single action may have multiple shortcuts but a single shortcut can only be linked to one action in a given darktable view \u0026ndash; you can\u0026rsquo;t chain actions together except by applying a preset or style. You can, however, set up a single shortcut that does one thing in the lighttable view and another in the darkroom view.\n🔗additional modifiers The only valid modifiers are the shift, ctrl and alt keys on the keyboard. You can assign any key (or input device buttons) to function as one of the existing modifier types by assigning keys/buttons to the \u0026ldquo;global/modifier\u0026rdquo; action. However, you cannot define new modifier types.\n🔗anatomy of an action Actions apply an effect to an element of a widget, where these terms are defined as follows:\nwidget Each visible part of the user interface is a widget. For example, the darktable application window is a widget, containing side panel widgets, each of which contains module widgets, each of which contains button, slider and dropdown list widgets etc. When assigning a shortcut to an action, you must first decide which widget it will apply to. element An element is the part of a UI widget that is affected by your shortcut. For example, for a slider that has a picker, you can make a shortcut activate the picker button element or change the value element of the slider. For a row of tabs (the row is a single widget) you can select which tab element to activate or use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll through the tabs. effect A shortcut can sometimes have multiple possible effects on a given element. For example, a button can be activated as if it was pressed with a plain mouse-click or as if it was pressed with Ctrl+click. A slider\u0026rsquo;s value can be edited, increased/decreased or reset. For example, you can assign the shortcut e + scroll to change the value (the effect) of the exposure slider (the element) of the exposure correction widget.\n🔗assigning shortcuts to actions There are two primary methods of assigning shortcuts to actions: visual shortcut mapping (recommended) and the shortcut mapping screen. The former makes it easier to remap multiple shortcuts at once, while the latter allows for finer control and more flexibility.\n🔗visual shortcut mapping Click on the icon in the top panel of any darktable view to enter visual shortcut mapping mode. If you hold Ctrl while clicking the button, no confirmation will appear when overwriting an existing shortcut mapping.\nThe mouse cursor will change as you hover over UI widgets, to indicate whether or not a mapping can be created:\nappears when you hover over a module header, to indicate that you can click to expand the module.\nindicates that, in addition to assigning a shortcut, you can also add the widget to the quick access panel in the darkroom (by Ctrl+clicking on it).\nindicates that the widget is already in the quick access panel (Ctrl+click to remove it).\nindicates that a shortcut can be defined for the widget under the cursor but it cannot be added to or removed from the quick access panel.\nindicates that there is no mappable widget under the cursor.\nTo define new shortcuts: Press a key combination while hovering over a mappable widget. A default action will be assigned to that shortcut based on the type of widget and whether it is directional. See the common actions section for examples of some of the defaults. You can assign as many shortcuts as you like in a single mapping session and then exit mapping mode when you are finished by clicking the icon again or right-clicking anywhere on the screen.\nTo explore already defined shortcuts: Left-click on a mappable widget to open the shortcut mapping screen for that widget (see below). Left-click anywhere else on the screen to open the shortcut mapping screen, expanded (where possible) based on the part of the screen you have clicked on. This screen can be used to alter the action assigned to a shortcut and to configure shortcuts for non-visual actions. Entering the shortcut mapping screen exits visual shortcut mapping mode.\nTo update existing shortcuts: Define a second shortcut against the same widget. If you attempt to reallocate an existing shortcut to a new action, you will be notified of the conflict and prompted to replace the existing shortcut.\nTo change the default speed of a slider: Scroll with your mouse wheel while in visual mapping mode (without pressing any other buttons/keys) when hovering over the slider \u0026ndash; scroll up to increase and down to decrease. When you leave mapping mode, normal mouse scrolls over that slider will change its value with the adjusted speed.\n🔗shortcut mapping screen The shortcut mapping screen can be accessed from the global preferences dialog or by right-clicking on the visual mapping button. This screen allows access to all available actions, including some that are not directly linked to a UI widget.\nThe top panel of the shortcut mapping screen shows a list of available UI widgets/actions and the bottom panel shows the shortcuts currently assigned to them. Fields that can be changed by user action are shown in bold.\nNote: You can search the top and bottom panels using the text entry boxes at the bottom of the screen, and use the up/down arrow keys to navigate between matches.\nTo create a new shortcut for an item: Double-click an item in the top panel, and then enter your desired shortcut (right-click to cancel). Once you have done this, a new entry will appear in the bottom panel showing the shortcut you have created. You can then manually alter the element, effect, speed or instance of the assigned action against that shortcut in the bottom panel. To delete a user-defined shortcut, select it in the bottom panel and press the Delete key.\nSelecting an existing shortcut in the bottom panel will highlight (in bold) the matching action and its parents in the top panel. You can use this to navigate the top panel and find related actions.\nThe following additional options are provided in the shortcut mapping screen:\nexport\u0026hellip; Export the current shortcut mappings for one or all of your devices (keyboard/mouse, midi, game controller) to an external file. The dialog will show you how many shortcuts exist for each device. import extras Import extended shortcuts from a system file (shortcutsrc, with an optional language suffix, from your darktable installation \u0026ndash; not the local config file of the same name). Existing shortcuts matching any in the system file will be replaced. These shortcuts will be localized to your system language if a localized version of the system file is available \u0026ndash; currently, only German (shortcutsrc.de) in addition to the default English. import\u0026hellip; Import shortcut mappings from an external file for one or all of your devices. When loading a device, you can chose to assign it a different number. This can for example be used to exchange midi layouts. Before loading, you can chose to wipe the specific device first. When loading all from an empty file, this will effectively delete all your shortcuts. restore\u0026hellip; Restore your shortcut mappings to (a) The mappings shipped with darktable by default, (b) The start of your current session, or (c) The point at which the shortcut mapping screen was last opened. When restoring, you can choose to leave any additional shortcuts that were added after the relevant checkpoint as they are, so that only changed shortcuts are restored to their previous meaning. Or you can choose to first clear all shortcuts and just load the restore point. 🔗deleting default shortcuts When you delete a shortcut that has been created by darktable by default, that shortcut is moved to a separate \u0026ldquo;disabled defaults\u0026rdquo; category, in order to prevent it from being reloaded the next time darktable is launched. To reinstate a deleted shortcut, simply delete the shortcut from that category. You will be prompted if reinstating this shortcut overwrites another one that has been created in the meantime.\nAlternatively, you may disable preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous \u0026gt; interface \u0026gt; load default shortcuts at startup to prevent default shortcuts from being loaded on startup. While this option is disabled, darktable will only load user-defined shortcuts and any defaults that you have not subsequently deleted or overridden.\n🔗common actions The following is a list of some of the actions to which you can assign shortcuts, organized by widget type. This is not an exhaustive list and you are encouraged to browse the shortcut mapping screen for a complete list of available actions.\nNote: Some actions may have no effect. For example, all sliders include a button element, regardless of whether such a button is actually present alongside a given slider.\n🔗global actions Actions in the \u0026ldquo;global\u0026rdquo; section of the shortcut mapping screen can be executed from any darktable view. Most of these actions do not have specific elements as they are used to perform one-off operations.\nFor example, the predefined shortcut tab triggers the action globals/panels/all, which toggles the visibility of all the side panels in the current view.\n🔗view-specific actions Actions in the \u0026ldquo;views\u0026rdquo; section can only be executed from the specified darktable view. As with global actions, most do not have specific elements as they are used to perform one-off operations.\nFor example, the predefined shortcut ctrl + b triggers the action views/darkroom/guide lines/toggle, which toggles guide lines in the darktable view. It has an effect setting which allows you to directly simulate a right-click on the button, which in this case opens the guide lines configuration popup.\n🔗actions on modules All utility and processing modules have the following elements:\nshow Acts as a toggle that expands and collapses the module. reset Acts as a button that resets all module parameters when activated. The ctrl-activate action can be used to re-apply any automatic presets for that module. presets Allows you to select actions from the presets menu (e.g. edit, update, previous, next). The default action, when assigning a discrete shortcut to a preset element, is to display a list of the available presets for selection. When a shortcut is assigned to a utility module, the default action is to toggle the show element (expand/collapse the module).\n🔗processing modules Additionally, processing modules have the following elements:\nenable Acts as a toggle that switches the module on and off. focus Acts as a toggle that focuses or unfocuses the module. This is useful for modules such as crop or tone equalizer, whose on-screen controls are only activated when those modules have focus. For crop, changes are saved only when the module loses focus. instance Allows you to select actions from the multiple-instance menu (e.g. move up/down, create new instance). The discrete action associated to the instance element displays a list of the available options for selection; a directional action is also available and will move the preferred module instance (see below) up and down the pixelpipe. If an action affects a processing module that can have multiple instances, you can choose which instance to adjust with a given shortcut. By default, all actions will affect the \u0026ldquo;preferred\u0026rdquo; instance, as defined using the settings in preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous \u0026gt; shortcuts with multiple instances.\nAdditional options are available in the shortcuts mapping screen to adjust the blend parameters (the \u0026lt;blending\u0026gt; section) and module controls (the \u0026lt;focused\u0026gt; section) for the currently-focused module. The latter section allows you to assign shortcuts to the first, second, third (etc.) button, drop-down, slider and tab on the module. The shortcuts will affect different module controls depending on which module currently has focus (as the available list of controls changes).\nFor example, you if you assign ' + scroll to processing modules/\\\u0026lt;focused\\\u0026gt;/sliders and set element to 1st, you will be able to use the scroll wheel while holding down ' to adjust the value of the first slider of the currently focused module. If exposure is focused you will affect the exposure correction slider, if denoise (profiled) is focused you will affect the denoising strength slider.\n🔗actions on specific widget types 🔗buttons A button is a clickable icon in the darktable interface. The default action is to activate that button as if clicked with the left mouse button. You can modify this action to activate the button as if clicked while holding a modifier key.\n🔗toggles A toggle is a button that has a persistent on/off state. It therefore has additional effects to allow you to toggle it or explicitly set its state. As with a normal button, the default action is to activate the toggle as if clicked with the left mouse button (which toggles the button on/off).\nFor example, the predefined shortcut shift + O is associated to views/darkroom/raw overexposed/toggle, which toggles on/off the raw overexposure indicator in the darkroom.\n🔗dropdowns A dropdown is a multi-selection box and has the following elements available:\nselection Allows values to be selected from the dropdown list in various ways. The default action, when assigning a discrete shortcut to a dropdown, is to display a popup edit box with a list of the available values for selection; A directional shortcut (i.e., including a mouse movement) will scroll through the available values. button A standard button element that allows the button to the right of the dropdown (if present) to be activated. For example, the aspect dropdown in the crop module has a button that allows the crop controls to be changed from portrait to landscape and vice versa. 🔗sliders A slider allows you to continuously alter an integer or decimal value, and has the following elements available:\nvalue Allows the current value of the slider to be altered. The default action, when assigning a discrete shortcut to a slider, is to display a popup edit box so you can enter a value; A directional shortcut will change the value up and down. Value elements are also used for modifying some on-screen graphs. When modifying the value element with a shortcut you may not exceed the bounds set in the visual slider. force This is the same as the value element described above, but it allows you to exceed the bounds set in the visual slider. zoom Allows you to change the upper and lower bounds of the visual slider without altering the current value. button A standard button element that allows the button to the right of the slider (if present) to be activated. For example, a slider may include a picker to visually set its value based on selected elements of the image. You can alter the value of a slider more quickly or slowly than normal by defining the speed of the action in the shortcut mapping screen. By default a value (or force) effect is given a speed of 1.0, which means that it is changed at the default rate defined by the given slider. You can alter the slider more quickly by increasing the speed (a speed of 10 makes the action 10x faster) or more slowly by decreasing it (a speed of 0.1 makes the action 10x slower).\n🔗fallbacks (a.k.a. generalized shortcut extensions) As discussed above, a widget can have multiple different actions applied to it, and you may want to set shortcuts to control several of them. For example, to toggle a module on/off, expand/collapse it, and reset it to its default state. Normally, this would require setting 3 shortcuts for each module. If you want to control 5 modules in this fashion, you have to define 15 shortcuts. Setting up all these shortcuts one by one can be tedious and error prone.\nTo make this process simpler and to ensure consistency across all modules, you can create a single discrete shortcut for each module and then have a number of effects made available by default as extensions to that shortcut. These generalized shortcut extensions are called shortcut fallbacks.\nNote: Fallbacks are a powerful way to quickly set up multiple actions using predefined and consistent shortcuts. They will assign a lot of actions automatically, which may be confusing if you are not aware of them. Fallbacks are therefore disabled by default and you will need to click on the enable fallbacks check box in the shortcuts setup window to enable them.\nIf they are enabled, when you create a discrete shortcut (e.g., ctrl + r) against a processing module the following shortcuts will be defined automatically:\nctrl + r to show/hide the module (the default fallback) ctrl + r + left click to enable/disable the module ctrl + r + left double-click to reset the module ctrl + r + right click to show the module\u0026rsquo;s preset menu ctrl + r + right double-click to show the module\u0026rsquo;s multiple instance menu In each case (except the first) you should hold the initial shortcut while clicking with your mouse. The final single/double mouse-click will apply the corresponding action.\nSimilar fallbacks are defined for many common UI elements. As with any other shortcut, fallback settings are fully customizable.\nTo see a list of all of the default fallbacks, click the \u0026ldquo;enable fallbacks\u0026rdquo; checkbox in the shortcut mapping screen and select the \u0026ldquo;fallbacks\u0026rdquo; category in the top panel. To see the fallbacks for a given widget (e.g. a slider) just select that widget in the top panel. In both cases an additional item (also named \u0026ldquo;fallbacks\u0026rdquo;) will then appear in the bottom panel containing full details of the available fallbacks.\nFallbacks are only applied if no other shortcut using the resulting combination has been explicitly created. In the above example, if you were to explicitly assign ctrl + r + left click to another action, the \u0026ldquo;enable/disable module\u0026rdquo; fallback would be ignored.\nSome fallback actions are defined using modifier keys (usually ctrl + and shift +). In this case you must define an initial shortcut without such a modifier in order to be able to use these fallbacks. For example, if you assign ctrl + r to an action, you cannot use a ctrl + fallback. Some default fallbacks of this type are provided for the value element and for horizontal/vertical movements in the (zoomed) central area \u0026ndash; in this case, shift + increases the speed to 10.0 and ctrl + decreases the speed to 0.1.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/","tags":null,"title":"shortcuts"},{"categories":null,"content":"This menu provides an overview of the presets that are defined for darktable\u0026rsquo;s modules, and allows you to modify some of their properties.\nPre-defined presets (those that are included by default within darktable) are shown with a lock symbol.

Removed images can no longer be viewed or edited within darktable but the image files remain on the filesystem along with any XMP sidecar files. As darktable keeps the XMP files up-to-date with your latest development history, you can fully restore your work later by re-importing the images. delete / delete (trash) Remove the selected images from the darktable library and remove any associated XMP sidecar files from the filesystem. If no duplicates of a removed image remain in the darktable library, the image file itself is also deleted. You can control whether this action irrevocably deletes the files or attempts to put them into your system\u0026rsquo;s trash bin with a configuration item in preferences \u0026gt; security. A second configuration item in the same tab allows you to control whether or not to be prompted before deleting images. move Physically move selected images (the image files plus all associated XMP sidecars) to another folder on the filesystem. If an image with the given filename already exists in the target folder the source image will not be moved. copy Physically copy selected images (the image file plus all associated XMP sidecars) to another folder on the filesystem. If an image with the given filename already exists in the target folder it will not be overwritten – instead a new duplicate will be generated with the same history stack as the source image. create hdr Create a high dynamic range image from the selected images, and add the result to the library as a new image in DNG format. Images need to be properly aligned, which implies that they have been taken on a sturdy tripod. You can also generate HDRs with programs like Luminance HDR, and later import them into darktable for further processing. Note that darktable can only create HDR images from raw files. duplicate Create duplicates of the selected images within darktable. Duplicate images share the same image file, but each duplicate has its own XMP sidecar file and a separate entry in darktable\u0026rsquo;s library database. This allows you to test different edits on the same image. rotation Perform a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation on the selected images.

Because the output color space is usually closely related to hardware with physical limitations, there is a maximum permitted value for the [R,G,B] channels, representing the maximum available intensity for that color space. Similarly, there is also a minimum value below which pixel values will be mapped to zero. When we try to convert from a larger color space to the final output color space, any values exceeding this maximum will be clamped to the maximum value, and any values below the minimum will be clamped to zero. This process is called \u0026ldquo;clipping\u0026rdquo; and it will lead to lost detail, or \u0026ldquo;incorrect\u0026rdquo; colors for any pixels with clipped channels.\nClick the icon to enable the clipping warning.\nThere are two ways in which a pixel might become clipped when represented in the output color space.\nluminance clipping: This can occur when a pixel is too bright to be represented in the output color space. The pixel luminance is calculated as a weighted average of the [R,G,B] channels. If this average exceeds the maximum allowed value, it is an indication of over-exposure. The overall luminance of a pixel can also be too dark to be represented by an [R,G,B] value in the output color space, in which case it will simply be shown as black. We normally deal with luminance clipping by carefully adjusting tone mappings and exposure levels.\ngamut clipping: The output color space defines a set of primary colors that, mixed together in certain ratios, produce the final output color. However, there are only so many colors that can be produced by mixing together a combination of those three primary colors. Highly saturated colors in particular can be difficult to represent, especially for pixels that are very bright or very dark. If there is no set of positive [R,G,B] values that can represent a given color at a given level of brightness, we say that the color is \u0026ldquo;out of gamut\u0026rdquo;, and we need to settle for another color instead that can be represented by permitted [R,G,B] values within the color space. We can handle gamut clipping by being careful not to over-saturate colors in the highlights and shadows, and possibly by using some color grading/color mapping techniques.\nThe \u0026ldquo;clipping warning\u0026rdquo; module is used to highlight those pixels that cannot be accurately represented in the output color space, either due to luminance or gamut clipping. Prior to darktable 3.4, the clipping highlighted any pixels that exceeded the maximum allowed value on any of the [R,G,B] channels, or that had been completely crushed to black. From darktable 3.4 onwards, the clipping warning indicator has some additional modes to help you to differentiate between luminance and gamut clipping, so that you can make better decisions about how to address any issues.\nAs the clipping warning runs at the end of the preview pixelpipe, it receives data in display color space then converts it to histogram color space. If you are using a display color space that is not \u0026ldquo;well behaved\u0026rdquo; (this is common for a device profile), then colors that are outside of the gamut of the display profile will clip or distort.\nThe clipping warning module, described here, warns you about clipping caused by image processing and the limitations of the output color space. It should not be confused with the following similar tools:\nThe raw overexposed warning indicates where pixels in the original raw file are clipped due to physical limitations in the dynamic range of the camera sensor. This module highlights information that was permanently lost at the point of image capture, and you need to deal with it as best you can using highlight recovery techniques.\nThe gamut check module also provides information about clipping arising from image processing. It is based on the external littleCMS library, and is more or less equivalent to the full gamut mode in the clipping warning module. The downsides of the gamut check module are that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to distinguish between clipping caused by luminance and gamut mapping, and it is much slower than the clipping warning indicator.\n🔗module controls Right-click on the clipping icon to show the following options:\nclipping preview mode Choose the type of clipping that you want to highlight: any RGB channel: Provides an over-clipping indication if any one of the three [R,G,B] channels exceeds the maximum permitted value for the histogram color space, or an under-clipping indication if the three [R,G,B] channels are too dark and are all forced to black. This was the default mode prior to darktable version 3.4. luminance only: Indicates any pixels that are clipped because their luminance falls outside of the range set in the \u0026ldquo;upper threshold\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;lower threshold\u0026rdquo; sliders. If this happens, it generally means that tone mapping or exposure settings have been poorly set saturation only: Indicates where over-saturated colors have pushed one or more of the [R,G,B] channels towards a value outside the permitted range of the histogram color space, even though the overall luminance of the pixel may lie within acceptable limits. This means that the pixel\u0026rsquo;s color is impossible to represent in the histogram color space, and can arise from poorly set gamut mapping or saturation settings, full gamut: Shows a combination of the three previous options. This is the default mode from darktable 3.4 onwards, and it gives the most complete indication of potentially problematic pixels. color scheme By default, the indicator marks pixels with red where the upper threshold is exceeded (over-clipping) and with blue where the lower threshold is breached (under-clipping). This color scheme can be changed to black \u0026amp; white or purple \u0026amp; green for \u0026ldquo;over \u0026amp; under\u0026rdquo; indicators, which may be useful to improve visibility for some images. lower threshold Expressed in EV relative to the white point (which is nominally EV = 0). If the [R,G,B] channels all fall below this value, an under-clipping indicator is shown warning that the pixel may be end up being crushed to black. Use the following reference to set this threshold, depending on your intended output medium: 8-bit sRGB clips blacks at \u0026ndash;12.69 EV 8-bit Adobe RGB clips blacks at \u0026ndash;19.79 EV 16-bit sRGB clips blacks at \u0026ndash;20.69 EV fine art matte prints typically produce black at \u0026ndash;5.30 EV color glossy prints typically produce black at \u0026ndash;8.00 EV black \u0026amp; white glossy prints typically produce black at \u0026ndash;9.00 EV upper threshold How close a pixel should be to the upper limit before being flagged by the clipping warning, expressed as a percentage (default 98%). In the case of gamut checks, this controls how close the saturation of the pixel is allowed to get to the limits of the color space\u0026rsquo;s gamut before a clipping indication is flagged.

This means, for example, that if you define complex filters like \u0026ldquo;A and B or C and not D\u0026rdquo; these will be implemented as \u0026ldquo;(A and B) or (C and (not D))\u0026rdquo;.\n🔗removing or deactivating filters You can remove or temporarily deactivate a specific filter using the buttons on the right of the filter header (see screenshots in the following sections). If a filter is pinned to the top panel, you will need to unpin it before removing or deactivating.\n🔗pinning into the top toolbar The pin button on the right of the filter header allows you to pin a filter to the top panel. To avoid unwanted actions, pinned filters can\u0026rsquo;t be removed or deactivated.\n🔗resetting filters Clicking on the module reset button will remove all un-pinned filters and reset all others to their default values. If you want to also remove the pinned filters, you can Ctrl+click on the reset button.\n🔗returning to a previous set of filters You can return to a previously-defined set of filters by clicking on the history button at the bottom of the module and selecting from the resulting list.\n🔗filter widgets A number of filter widgets have been created for use within this module. Since some of these widgets use non-standard interfaces, their usage is explained in the following sections:\n🔗color labels The following image shows the color labels widget, set to filter images having yellow or green color labels:\nYou can interact with this filter widget as follows:\nClick on a color label to include images with that label Ctrl+click on a color label to include images without that label Click or Ctrl+click on the gray icon to act on all color labels simultaneously Use the last button to define how to handle the selection of multiple color labels. Select (and) to filter images having all of the selected color labels; Select (or) to filter images with at least one of the selected color labels. 🔗rating This is the classic rating selection widget that used to be shown in darktable\u0026rsquo;s top panel by default.\nThis widget is composed of a pair of comboboxes. The combobox on the right (always visible) is used to choose a number of stars, plus some additional options (\u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;unstarred only\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;rejected only\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;all except rejected\u0026rdquo;). The combobox to the left (only shown when a star rating is chosen in the right-hand combobox) is used to choose an operator (\u0026lt;, \u0026lt;=, =, \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=, ≠).\n🔗range rating This new widget also allows you to select images by star rating, this time using a new \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; widget. The following image shows the widget with ratings of 2-4 stars selected.\nYou can choose a new range of ratings to filter by clicking and dragging over the widget\u0026rsquo;s interface. You can also access pre-defined ranges by right-clicking and selecting from the popup menu. The number of applicable images is also shown against each entry in this menu.\n🔗range filters for numeric attributes Numeric attributes (aperture, exposure, focal length, iso, aspect ratio) are filtered using a widget that shows a histogram of the number of images available depending on the value of the given attribute (similar to the timeline in the lighttable view).\nFor example, the following image shows the widget when used for selecting by aperture:\nAs with the range rating filter, you can select a range of values to filter by clicking and dragging on the widget. You can also access predefined ranges by right-clicking and selecting from the popup menu. The number of applicable images is also shown against each entry in this menu.\nYou can also use the \u0026ldquo;min\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;max\u0026rdquo; text entry fields in the main module interface to manually define the bounds of the selection.\n🔗date attributes As with numeric and rating range filters, date/time filters are represented using a \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; widget. You can select a range of values by clicking and dragging on the widget, and use the right-click menu for more options.\nYou can also use the \u0026ldquo;min\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;max\u0026rdquo; text entry fields in the main module interface to manually define the bounds of the selection (right-click for more options).\nThe date/time format used by this module is YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS (only the year values are mandatory).\nThe keyword now is allowed in the max field (to define the current date/time).\nYou can also use \u0026ldquo;relative\u0026rdquo; date/time values by preceding text entries with + or -. This allows you to set the maximum or minimum bound of the range relative to the other bound. As an example if you set the min value to -0000:01 and the max value to 2022:04:15, this will select images taken during the month before April 15th 2022.\n🔗filename The filename filter allows you to search images by their filename and/or extension. You can either enter the name or extension (with the leading .) manually or use the right-click menu to select.\nWithin the extension field, you can also use the keywords RAW (to select all handled RAW file extensions), NOT RAW (to select all non-RAW file extensions), LDR (to select low-dynamic-range extensions) or HDR (to select high-dynamic-range extensions).\n🔗camera, lens The camera and lens filters are presented text entry fields into which you can enter text to filter by. Alternatively, you can right-click on the text box to see a list of cameras or lenses to select from.\n🔗text search You can search images using any of their text properties (path, filename, filmroll, tags, metadata, camera, maker) using the text search filter. The search is performed \u0026ldquo;on-the-fly\u0026rdquo; and the widget is dimmed during the search process.\nBy default darktable performs a \u0026ldquo;fuzzy\u0026rdquo; search (wildcards are automatically added to the start and the end of the text). If you want to search for an exact match, you can enclose it with double-quotes (\u0026quot;match this exactly\u0026quot;).\n🔗sorting The bottom part of the module allows you to define the sort order of the images when displayed in the lighttable and filmstrip views. As with the filter criteria, you can add multiple rules to this section. However, only the first-selected sort criteria is pinned to the top panel (this cannot be unpinned).\nAs with filter criteria, the history button allows you to access any previously-used sort criteria.\nThe button to the right of the attribute selection allows you to choose whether to sort that criteria in ascending or descending order.\n🔗custom sort Setting the sort order to \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; presents images in any sequence you define. Images are initally ordered by an image property (import order, image capture time, file name, etc.) but you can then incrementally alter \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; sequences by dragging-and-dropping images within the lighttable view. Be careful: an erroneous drag-and-drop can easily ruin one or more painstakingly-created image sequences.\n🔗warnings Please bear the following warnings in mind when using custom sort\n\u0026ldquo;Undo\u0026rdquo; does not reverse drag-and-drop resequencing.\nDrag-and-drop resequencing is always enabled in lighttable filemanager and in the filmstrip, but any resulting changes are invisible if \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; is not currently in effect.\nEnsure any image you drag is not selected unless you want to reposition the entire currently-selected set.\nAim your \u0026ldquo;drops\u0026rdquo; accurately: verify the correct target is highlighted before dropping!\nCustom sort positions are lost if images are removed from darktable or their tags are detached or deleted (since sort order is not stored in an image\u0026rsquo;s sidecar file).\nDo not use \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; for tag-based collections that specify a wild-card (\u0026quot;*\u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;%\u0026rdquo;) expression.\nWhen a wild-card tag expression does not resolve to a single tag, drag-and-drop operates only on the sequence of the first matching tag. If that tag is attached to a source image, that image is resequenced. If the same tag is also attached to the target image, the drop occurs there; if not, resequenced images appear at the top or bottom of the collection\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo;. If the first matching tag is not attached to a source image, the image is not repositioned. The \u0026ldquo;tag case sensitivity\u0026rdquo; preference is also relevant here: \u0026ldquo;insensitive\u0026rdquo; treats \u0026ldquo;%\u0026rdquo; (but not \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo;) as a string-match wild card. The global sequence is not affected in any of these cases.\n🔗which custom sort sequence? The collection type determines which image sequence drag-and-drop changes. If the collection\u0026rsquo;s selection criteria includes tag, then a tag-based \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; sequence is altered. Otherwise, the global \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; sequence is altered. Collection filters (even if tag-based) do not influence which sequence is changed by drag-and-drop.\nWhen \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; is in effect, dragged-and-dropped images are immediately presented in their new (tag-based or global) \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; sequence.\n🔗what to drag, where to drop? While viewing a collection in filemanager or the filmstrip, you may drag any hovered-over (highlighted) image to any other image in the displayed collection. Empty space before, between, or after images is not a recognized drop target.\nYou may relocate a single image (unselected or single selection) or a selected set of images by dragging one of them to the desired position as follows:\nWhen sort order is \u0026ldquo;ascending\u0026rdquo; the dragged image/set will be placed before the image you drop it on to.\nWhen sort order is \u0026ldquo;descending\u0026rdquo; the dragged image/set will be placed after the image you drop it on to.\nAbort an accidental drag by dropping the dragged image outside of the thumbnail display. If all peripheral panels are hidden, then drop the dragged image on itself. If multiple images were selected, the entire selected set will be relocated to that spot.\nIf the \u0026ldquo;dropped on\u0026rdquo; image is subsequently resequenced, filtered out, or even deleted, the dropped image(s) remain where the \u0026ldquo;dropped on\u0026rdquo; image was located.\n🔗which image is last (or, in descending sort, first)? An image dropped after the last image on lighttable is regarded as dropped on the last image, thus positioned before it.\nTo change the last image in an \u0026ldquo;ascending\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; display, drop it on the existing last image, then drag-and-drop that last image on its intended replacement.\nIf you expect to use a \u0026ldquo;descending\u0026rdquo; sort, do the opposite to change the first image.\n🔗suggested process If you intend to present a collection in more than one \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; sequence or if some images in a collection are included in other collections to be displayed with a different global \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo;, then tag-based collections should be used.\nFor tag-based \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; only:\nSet sort by to the image attribute and sort order (ascending or descending) you want as your tag\u0026rsquo;s initial sequence, Select the images to be sequenced, and in the right-hand panel at tagging (bottom half) add a new tag or click on an existing tag. The tag is now attached to the selected images in the displayed sequence. Note the tag\u0026rsquo;s increased image count. Change collections selection crierion to \u0026ldquo;tag\u0026rdquo; and choose the newly-applied tag. Note that the newly-tagged images are shown. Long-distance drags are difficult because neither filemanager nor filmstrip scroll while you drag. Try to fit drag sources and targets onto the same screen by maximizing the the window and scrolling the display. If that\u0026rsquo;s not sufficient:\nincrease the number of images displayed (thus shrinking thumbnails) or hide images between drag source and drop target using collection filters (e.g. by ranges of \u0026ldquo;datetime captured\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;image id\u0026rdquo;). Rearrange the images as you desire:\nClear any active selection (selection \u0026gt; select none). Set sort by \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;custom sort\u0026rdquo; so you can verify your changes immediately. Remember the warnings above as you drag-and-drop.

This set of filtered images is known as a collection.\nImporting images into darktable stores information about them (filename, path, Exif data, data from XMP sidecar files etc.) in darktable\u0026rsquo;s library database. A collection may be defined by applying filtering rules to these attributes, thus creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view and the filmstrip module.\nThe default collection is based on the film roll attribute and displays all images of the last imported or selected film roll.\nThe sort order of the listed collections (ascending/descending) can be toggled by clicking .\n🔗filtering attributes The images in a collection can be filtered using the following image attributes:\n🔗files film roll The name of the film roll to which the image belongs (which is the same as the name of the folder in which the image resides).

This pattern is compared against all database entries with the selected attribute. The filtering mechanism detects a match if any image\u0026rsquo;s attribute contains the pattern in its full text. You may use % as wildcard character. The collection will be limited to only the matching images. Leave the text field empty to match all images having that attribute. Where applicable, a tooltip will appear if you hover over the attribute or search pattern to provide additional information. Attributes with numerical or date/time attributes can be used in combination with comparative and range operators. Use \u0026lt;, \u0026lt;=, \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, or = to select images with attributes less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal, not equal, or equal to the given value, respectively. An expression in the form [from;to] can be used to select using a range of values.\nselect by value As well as defining filter criteria using a search pattern, you can also manually choose from a list of values (for the chosen attribute) taken from the currently-matching set of images. Making such a selection will automatically populate the \u0026ldquo;search pattern\u0026rdquo; field. The box below the search pattern will list values for the selected attribute that are present in the currently-selected images. This list is continuously updated as you type. You may also choose a sorting criteria by scrolling through the list and double-clicking.\nIf you enable single-click mode (see preferences \u0026gt; lighttable) you can select with a single-click rather than double-click. This mode also allows you to select a range of values with the mouse. This only works for numerical and date-time attributes.\n🔗combining multiple filters You can combine multiple filters together to create more complex collections of images using a series of rules. A rule is a combination of a filter criteria along with a logical operation that defines how that criteria is combined with any previous rules.\nClick on the button (to the right of the search field) to open a menu with the following options:\nclear this rule Remove the current rule, or reset it if this is the only rule defined. narrow down search Add a new rule, which is combined with the previous rule(s) in a logical AND operation. An image is only retained as part of the collection if it also fulfills the new criteria. add more images Add a new rule, which is combined with the previous rule(s) in a logical OR operation. Images that fulfill the new criteria are added to the collection. exclude images Add a new rule, which is combined with the previous rule(s) in a logical EXCEPT operation. Images that fulfill the new criteria are removed from the collection. The logical operators defining how rules are combined are indicated with icons to the right of each added rule: AND by the symbol, OR by the symbol, and EXCEPT by the symbol. Click on any of these icons to change the logical operation for that rule.\n🔗updating the folder path of moved images While it is best to not touch imported files behind darktable\u0026rsquo;s back, this module can help you to recover from situations when you have moved or renamed image folders after importing them. The collections module has a feature that allows you to update darktable\u0026rsquo;s library database with the new folder location. The process is as follows:\nSet the image attribute combobox to \u0026ldquo;folder\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;film roll\u0026rdquo;. The original film roll or folder name will be displayed with strikethrough formatting to emphasize that it can not be located. Right-click on the folder or film roll name, select \u0026ldquo;update path to files\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, and then select the new location of the folder. 🔗returning to a previous collection You can return to a previously-defined collection by clicking on the history button at the bottom of the module or using the recently used collections module \u0026ndash; see the preferences section for more details.\n🔗preferences The \u0026ldquo;preferences\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; option in the presets menu allows you to adjust the behavior of the collections module as follows:\ndo not set the \u0026lsquo;uncategorized\u0026rsquo; entry for tags Do not set the \u0026lsquo;uncategorized\u0026rsquo; category for tags that do not have children (default off). tag case sensitivity Set whether tags should be case sensitive or not \u0026ndash; without the sqlite ICU extension this will only apply to the 26 latin letters (default insensitive). number of collections to be stored Set the number of recent collections to show in the history popup (if present). number of folder levels to show in lists The number of folder levels to show in film roll names, starting from the right (default 1). sort film rolls by Sort film rolls by either the \u0026ldquo;folder name\u0026rdquo; (path) or the \u0026ldquo;import time\u0026rdquo; (the date the film rolls were first imported) (default \u0026ldquo;import time\u0026rdquo;).

If an image is displayed against a dark background, this can have a number of adverse effects on our perception of that image:\nExaggeration of the perceived exposure makes the image seems brighter than it really is. This is nicely illustrated by the Adelson checkerboard shadow effect. A decrease in the perceived saturation in the image makes the colors seem less rich than they really are (the Hunt effect). A decrease in the perceived contrast in the image makes the tones seem flatter than they really are (Bartleson-Breneman effect 3) The end result is that the final image can end up being too dark and overly-processed in terms of contrast and color saturation. To avoid this, the color assessment module in the darktroom places a grey and white frame around the image to help the user better assess the colors in the image\nWhen the color assessment button is selected in the bottom panel, the image is zoomed out so that a thick mid-gray border appears around the image to act as a reference against which to compare the image\u0026rsquo;s tones. A thinner white border is placed immediately around the image to give the eyes a basis for comparison when looking at parts of the image that are meant to be a bright white.\nAlthough the color assessment mode provides a mid-gray surrounding to the image, it is recommended that you also set your user interface (in preferences \u0026gt; general) to one of the \u0026ldquo;grey\u0026rdquo; themes. These themes are designed to provide a user interface that is close to middle gray (it is actually slightly darker to allow better contrast with the text in the user interface). When one of these themes is used together with the color assessment mode, this will help to avoid the above perception issues.\nColor assessment mode can also be toggled by pressing Ctrl+B.\nThe total size of the grey and white frame and the relative size of the white frame may be adjusted by right-clicking . This will bring up a control panel with two slider controls:\ntotal border width relative to screen Adjust the size of the combined grey and white border. Increase to grow the total border (and shrink the image). Decrease shrink the border (and grow the image). white border ratio Adjust the white border relative to the screen. Increase this slider to enlarge the the white border. Decrease to shrink the white border. The image size will remain unaffected.

A number of different back-ends are implemented, including file on disk, LaTeX book template and various web albums. Depending on the selected target, you will be asked to provide additional information, such as filenames or account name and password. filename template Define the folder and file to which the image will be exported. This can be automatically generated using several pre-defined variables. For example, $(SEQUENCE) in a template records sequence number of the image exported to the target. See the variables section for details. output directory selector The button beside the filename template entry opens a dialog to select the parent directory for export. on conflict Choose what to do if the generated filename conflicts with an existing file on export: create unique filename: Automatically choose a unique new file name by appending an integer to name of the conflicting file. overwrite: Automatically overwrite existing files. This option will present you with a confirmation dialog in order to protect you from accidental data loss \u0026ndash; you can disable this in preferences \u0026gt; security \u0026gt; ask before exporting in overwrite mode.

Additional options will appear (below) depending on the selected format. quality The quality of the exported file. Higher values lead to larger file sizes. The default quality (95) is a good setting for very high quality exports (e.g. for archiving or printing purposes). If you need a good compromise between size and quality (e.g. for online image display or uploads) you should consider a value of “90” instead. bit depth The number of bits used for each color channel. More bits means less posterization/color banding. compression The type of compression to use. compression level For export formats where compression can be specified, the compression level specifies how much compression to apply. The higher the level, the more the data will be compressed, at the cost of more CPU cycles. b\u0026amp;w image For TIFF export format, it is possible to save a monochrome image. This setting controls whether the resulting file encodes the shades of gray as separate RGB channels, or as a single grayscale channel. The latter option will result in smaller files. 🔗global options set size Choose how to measure the maximum size of your exported image in pixels (for file): Enter the maximum width and height in pixels. in cm (for print): Enter the maximum width and height in cm and define the image\u0026rsquo;s dpi. The equivalent size in pixels will be automatically calculated. in inch (for print): Enter the maximum width and height in inches and define the image\u0026rsquo;s dpi. The equivalent size in pixels will be automatically calculated. by scale (for file): Enter a multiplier to specify by how much the exported image should be scaled compared to the input image. For example, entering a value of 0.5 will result in an output image with half the width and height (in pixels) of the original image. dpi If units of cm or inches are chosen, set the dpi of the output image. The dpi will also be stored in the Exif data of the exported image. It will be automatically set to 300 if \u0026ldquo;in pixels\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;by scale\u0026rdquo; is chosen. max size Set the maximum width and height of the exported image(s) in pixels, cm or inches (depending on the selected unit) \u0026ndash; zero means that no constraint will be set on that dimension. Exported images will be constrained so as not to exceed either of these values, while retaining the correct aspect ratio. Set both to zero to export with the original dimensions (after cropping). If the entered values exceed the original dimensions darktable will either export with the original dimensions or upscale the image, depending on the \u0026ldquo;allow upscaling\u0026rdquo; parameter. allow upscaling Set to “yes” to perform an upscaling step if the user-defined maximum width and height exceed the original dimensions of the image. If set to “no” the exported image\u0026rsquo;s dimensions will not exceed the dimensions of the original image (after cropping). high quality resampling Set this to \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; to perform high quality resampling on the image. The image will be processed in full resolution and only downscaled at the very end. This can sometimes result in better quality, but will always be slower. store masks Store masks as additional layers (for TIFF format) or channels (for EXR and XCF formats) in the exported image. profile The output color profile. Select “image settings” if you want the settings in the output color profile module of the individual images to be respected. intent This option lets you define the intent \u0026ndash; the way in which darktable will handle out-of-gamut colors. See rendering intent for a more detailed description of the available options. style Choose a style which darktable will combine with the existing history stack to generate the output image. These history items are only added temporarily \u0026ndash; the original history stack is not overwritten. You can use this feature to add processing steps and parameters that you want to be applied specifically to images before export. For example you may define a style that adds a stronger level of sharpening when you produce scaled-down JPEG files for the internet or add a certain level of exposure compensation to all of your output images. mode When applying a style during export this option defines whether the history stack items of that style replace the original history stack of the image or are appended to it. Technically speaking, in append mode history stack items of the style will constitute separate instances of the respective modules on top of any existing ones (see also multiple instances). As a consequence the original history stack will remain in effect with the new items being applied in addition. This way you can apply an overall adjustment (e.g. exposure) to a number of exported images while respecting the settings of each individual image. start export Press this button to start a background job to export all selected images. A bar at the bottom of the left hand panel displays the progress of the export job. Furthermore a notification message pops up reporting the completion of each individual export. You may click on the pop-up to make it disappear. You may abort the export job by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon located close to the progress bar. multi-preset export Expanding this section allows you to easily export each of the selected images with several different presets in a single export run. For example, you may wish to export each image in multiple sizes at the same time for use in a website. Simply create a preset for each type of export you wish to make, ensuring that the file path settings for each preset is unique (so that the exported images don\u0026rsquo;t overwrite one another). Select the desired presets and press the \u0026ldquo;start export\u0026rdquo; button as normal. Note: Images that are selected but currently hidden (because they are members of a collapsed group) will not be exported.\n🔗metadata preferences The “preferences…” option in the presets menu brings up a dialog where you can configure what metadata to include in exported files:\nThe parameters entered into this dialog are saved along with other export parameters to user presets and the last entered values are retained when darktable is closed.\n🔗general settings The left-hand-side of this dialog allows you to choose which groups of metadata are to be exported with the image. The following options are available:\nexif data Export the source image\u0026rsquo;s Exif data. metadata Export metadata defined in the metadata editor module. Only metadata fields that are tagged as visible and are not tagged as private will be exported. geo tags Export geo tags. tags Export tags created in the tagging module (to Xmp.dc.Subject). Three additional options can also be selected: private tags: Export private tags synonyms: Export tag synonyms omit hierarchy: Only export the last part of hierarchical tags hierarchical tags Export hierarchical tags (to Xmp.lr.Hierarchical Subject) develop history Export the entire development history (history stack and shapes) where supported (e.g. JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF). The development history will be stored as XMP tags within the output file. This information can later be used to reconstruct the parameters and settings that were used to produce the exported image. Caution: For various reasons embedding XMP tags into output files may fail without notice, e.g. if certain size limits are exceeded. Users are therefore advised to not rely on this feature for their backup strategy. To back up your data always make sure to save your input (raw) file as well as all of darktable\u0026rsquo;s XMP sidecar files.\n🔗per metadata settings The right-hand-side of this dialog allows you to define formulas to populate image metadata. The formulas defined here have priority over the settings in the left-hand-side of the dialog. The first column identifies the entry to be edited. The second column allows you to define how to calculate the value for that metadata entry using a formula.\nSee the variables section for details of the variables you can use in your metadata formula. Press Enter to validate the formula. Leave the formula empty to prevent a given metadata entry from being exported (Exif.GPSInfo.GPSVersionID in the above example).\nUse the “\u0026ndash;” icon to remove a metadata entry from the list and the “+” icon to add a new one from a predefined list of available metadata tags.\nClick on the \u0026ldquo;add\u0026rdquo; button to add a metadata entry to the list.\nThe formulas allow you virtually define all the metadata you need to qualify your images in tagging and export the values in the XMP or IPTC tags of your choice. The exported tags can be different from one export to the next depending on the destination of the images. Tags and Categories are displayed separately in image information.\nRemember that a tag set up as a category is never exported.\n🔗tips To prevent a specific metadata field from being exported, add it to the list and leave the formula empty. To force a specific exif metadata field to be exported when exif export is disabled, add it to the list and enter = into the formula. 🔗examples example 1 A first level tag called places is set as a category, and is followed by four levels of information (or keywords): country, region, city and location (e.g. places|France|Nord|Lille|rue Nationale). Each level can be retrieved (when it is defined) by one of the variables $(CATEGORY0(places)), $(CATEGORY1(places)), $(CATEGORY2(places)) and $(CATEGORY3(places)). In this example, the returned values are \u0026ldquo;France\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Nord\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Lille\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rue Nationale\u0026rdquo;, respectively. These keywords can also be retrieved as simple tags using the variable $(TAGS). The last keyword level defined (the leaf) is displayed in image information, here \u0026ldquo;rue Nationale\u0026rdquo;. example 2 A first level tag called creator is followed by the name of the photographer, both set as categories: creator|firstname lastname. The formula copyrights ($(YEAR) $(CATEGORY0(creator))) builds the text associated with image rights. Here, image information displays \u0026ldquo;creator: firstname lastname\u0026rdquo; as categories. Neither creator nor \u0026ldquo;firstname lastname\u0026rdquo; appear in the tags list and they are not exported as simple tags. Note: tagging is not appropriate to define free text metadata, like a title or a description, which may be specific to each image. Use the metadata editor for this type of information.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/shared/export/","tags":null,"title":"export"},{"categories":null,"content":"The filmstrip can be used to quickly switch between images.

Note: While the algorithm in this module generally does a good job of locating the sharpest parts of an image, it does not necessarily detect whether an image is sharp. Additionally, as it uses local contrast to detect sharpness, it will also highlight the edges of dark objects against bright backgrounds (and vice versa) even if those edges are blurred. Because it runs at the end of the pixelpipe, it may also detect the results of any sharpening you have performed within darktable.\nThe following example image was taken with a wide aperture to give a shallow depth of field, and you can see how the camera has focused on the chinese character written on the second red lantern along from the front.

The map view provides an enhanced mode that allows you to preview the position of the images along the GPS tracks while adjusting the images\u0026rsquo; date/time offset and time zone.\n🔗workflow overview A GPS receiver calculates its current position based on information it receives from satellites, and records it in a GPX file together with the current date and time. The Exif data of the images also contains a time stamp defined by the camera settings. The geotagging module takes the time stamp of the image, looks up the position in the GPX file at that time, and stores the appropriate coordinates (latitude/longitude/elevation) in its database and the image\u0026rsquo;s XMP sidecar file.\nTwo problems may occur during this process:\nIn contrast to GPS devices, most cameras don\u0026rsquo;t record the time accurately. The time stored in the Exif data does not include the time zone. Most people set their camera to local time, whereas GPS devices store the time in the UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated, i.e. Greenwich (London)) time zone. If the time zones of the camera and GPX file differ, than the related location will be wrong. If your image already shows the correct date/time and carries the UTC time stamp, you can directly apply the GPX track file without further adjustments.\nOtherwise follow the following process to correlate the time of the images and GPS track files\nFix the camera time setting for a single image by manually entering the correct date/time for that image into the date/time field. A good way to do this accurately is to take a photograph of a reliable time source. This can be any precise clock or, even better, the time displayed on your GPS device (bearing in mind that GPS devices normally show the local time, even though they store universal time).

The individual date/time fields can be altered by scrolling over them with your mouse. If any field reaches its limit, the neighboring fields are automatically updated. For example, if you go over 60 on the minute field, the hour field will automatically be incremented. It is also possible to use milliseconds in this module if you enable preferences \u0026gt; lighttable \u0026gt; show image time with milliseconds. original date/time The original date/time of the image is shown here for reference. date/time offset The calculated difference between the original date/time and that keyed in the date/time field.

The \u0026ldquo;append\u0026rdquo; button will take each module from the copied history stack and if there is a module in the destination image with the same name, it will be replaced and added to the top of the history stack. If there is no such module, a new instance will be created and added to the top of the history stack. If a module has multiple instances in either history stack, only the last occurence of that module will be added. paste Paste all items of a copied history stack onto all selected images. This has the same behavior as the \u0026ldquo;append\u0026rdquo; button in the \u0026ldquo;selective paste\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; controls. This behavior also applies when using copy and paste keyboard shortcuts. Notes:\nAutomatic module presets are only added to an image when it is first opened in the darkroom or its history stack is discarded. If you use the \u0026ldquo;overwrite\u0026rdquo; mode to paste history stack entries to images that haven\u0026rsquo;t previously been opened in the darkroom, then the next time that image is opened in the darkroom automatic presets will be applied to the image. It may therefore seem as if the \u0026ldquo;overwrite\u0026rdquo; behavior did not accurately duplicate the existing history stack, but in this case, those automatic modules were added after the paste action.\nThe \u0026ldquo;append\u0026rdquo; mode allows you to later reconstruct your pre-existing history stack (because previous history items are retained in the stack of the destination image). However, with the \u0026ldquo;overwrite\u0026rdquo; mode all previous edits are irrevocably lost.\ncompress history Compress the history stack of the selected image. If any module appears multiple times in the history stack, these occurrences will be compressed into a single step in the history. Beware: this action can not be undone! discard history Physically delete the history stack of the selected images. Beware: this action can not be undone! load sidecar file Open a dialog box which allows you to import the history stack from a selected XMP file. The imported history stack is used to completely replace the current history stack(s) of the selected image(s). Caution: this operation can not be undone! Images that were exported by darktable typically contain the full history stack if the file format supports embedded metadata (see the export module for details of this feature and its limitations). You can load an exported image as a sidecar file in the same way as you can with an XMP file. This feature allows you to recover all parameter settings if you have accidentally lost or overwritten the XMP file. All you need is the source image, typically a raw, and the exported file.\nwrite sidecar files Write XMP sidecar files for all selected images. The filename is generated by appending “.xmp” to the name of the underlying input file. By default darktable generates and updates sidecar files automatically whenever you work on an image and change the history stack. You can disable automatic sidecar file generation in preferences \u0026gt; storage. This can be useful when you are running multiple versions of darktable (so that edits in each version do not conflict with one another) however, in general, disabling this feature is not recommended.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/history-stack/","tags":null,"title":"history stack"},{"categories":null,"content":"Display information embedded within an image\u0026rsquo;s Exif data as well as a number of additional data fields defined by darktable.\nWhen hovering with the mouse over image thumbnails, the displayed data is automatically updated to show information about the image currently under the mouse cursor.\nWhen several images are selected and the focus is not on a single image, the module only displays information that is the same for all images.

Any populated strings are automatically added to the imported images. You can also choose from any presets saved within the metadata editor module. Double-click on a label to reset the corresponding field. Double-click on the \u0026ldquo;metadata presets\u0026rdquo; label to reset all fields.\nIf preferences \u0026gt; storage \u0026gt; create XMP files is set to \u0026ldquo;never\u0026rdquo;, an additional column \u0026ldquo;from XMP\u0026rdquo; is presented so that you can choose to prevent the import of metadata from XMP files.\ntags If you want to add further tags by default when importing images, you can provide them here as a comma separated list. As with metadata you can also choose from any presets saved within the tagging module. 🔗import dialog Each of the three import buttons (add to library, copy \u0026amp; import, copy \u0026amp; import from camera) uses a similar dialog for the import process, described in this section.\nThe following example screenshot is taken from the \u0026ldquo;add to library\u0026rdquo; button:\n🔗common functionality 🔗places and folders The import dialog is intended to allow you to set up common import locations, to make subsequent imports as simple as possible. When you first open the dialog, darktable attempts to add some common locations (home, pictures, mounted devices) to the places pane. You can add new places to the list by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button and you can remove places from the list by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; button. If you wish to restore a default location that you have deleted, you can do this with the reset button.\nWhen you choose a place, the folder tree is automatically populated (into the folders pane) from the root directory of the selected place. You can then navigate the folder tree and select a folder for import. The last selected place/folder is automatically reloaded the next time you open the dialog.\nIn the example screenshot above, you can see that a \u0026ldquo;place\u0026rdquo; has been created for the root of the Photos folder and a sub-folder within that structure has been selected. This is the recommended workflow for the import process \u0026ndash; you should not have to create new places very often.\n🔗files Once you have selected a folder, the files pane will automatically be populated with a list of the files found in that folder. By default, all files in the chosen folder are selected.\nYou can view thumbnails for any of the images by clicking on the icon. In addition, buttons are available at the bottom of the screen to select \u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo; files or \u0026ldquo;none\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce you are happy with your selection, press Enter or click on the button at the bottom-right of the screen to import (this button will be named differently depending on the type of import being performed).\nPress Escape or click the \u0026ldquo;cancel\u0026rdquo; button to exit without importing.\n🔗common options The following additional options are common to all import dialogs:\nrecursive directory Check this option to import images in the selected folder and all subfolders. It is recommended that you not use this option to import a large number of images at the same time. The import process causes darktable to generate thumbnails for all of the imported images, but in the end it will only be able to keep the most recent in its cache. It is therefore better to import images in smaller chunks to avoid the performance penalty this imposes. ignore non-raw images Check this option if there are non-RAW images in the same folder that you do not wish to import. This option is usually used where the camera stores RAW+JPEG and you only want to work on the RAW files, leaving the JPEG images untouched. 🔗add to library The \u0026ldquo;add to library\u0026rdquo; button allows you to add one or more existing images to the darktable library from the local filesystem. This process does not copy or move images but merely adds their details to the library database and creates XMP sidecar files for them.\nselect only new images Tick this box to restrict the initial selection (when the dialog is loaded) to only those images that have not already been loaded into the darktable library. If you attempt to reload existing images into the darktable library, data for those images will be reloaded from the XMP sidecar files. A button is also available at the bottom of the dialog to select only \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; images for the currently-selected folder. Note: \u0026ldquo;Add to library\u0026rdquo; does not create duplicates of your image files in a separate folder structure but processes them in-situ. The \u0026ldquo;add to library\u0026rdquo; process simply adds details of those images to darktable\u0026rsquo;s library database (and creates an XMP sidecar file if applicable) allowing the images to be viewed and developed.\nThis means that if you delete images from disk after having added them, darktable cannot access them any more. Moreover, darktable does not watch for changes in the filesystem. Any new images will not be shown until they are explicitly imported.\n🔗copy \u0026amp; import This option copies images from another location on your filesystem (including mounted storage devices) and then adds the copied images to the darktable library. Using this option, if an existing XMP sidecar file is available for the image, it will not be read or copied and a new XMP will be created.\nThe following additional options are available to control the file and directory naming of the copied files. By default, only the \u0026ldquo;import job\u0026rdquo; option is shown \u0026ndash; click on the \u0026ldquo;naming rules\u0026rdquo; label or the expander icon beside it to show additional options:\nimport job The name of the import job (populated into the $(JOBCODE) variable). override today\u0026rsquo;s date Enter a valid date/time (in YYYY-MM-DD[Thh:mm:ss] format) if you want to override the current date/time used when expanding the variables $(YEAR), $(MONTH), $(DAY), $(HOUR), $(MINUTE) and $(SECONDS). Leave the field empty otherwise. base filmroll\u0026rsquo;s directory The base directory part of the naming pattern (default $(PICTURES_FOLDER)/Darktable). Click on the icon beside the input field to choose a directory manually. filmroll name The sub directory part of the naming pattern (default $(YEAR)$(MONTH)$(DAY)_$(JOBCODE)). keep original filename Check this box to keep the original filename instead of using the pattern below when importing. file naming pattern The file name part of the naming pattern (default $(YEAR)$(MONTH)$(DAY)_$(SEQUENCE).$(FILE_EXTENSION)). keep this window open Keep the window open after the import is complete, allowing multiple imports but with different naming options. Most of these options can also be set in preferences \u0026gt; import. See this section for more information about the available variables.\n🔗copy \u0026amp; import from camera This option copies files from a connected camera to the local filesystem and then adds the copied images to the darktable library. It provides the same naming options as the \u0026ldquo;copy \u0026amp; import\u0026rdquo; dialog but does not allow places or folders to be selected.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import/","tags":null,"title":"import"},{"categories":null,"content":"Control your camera\u0026rsquo;s live view mode.\nFunctionality such as focus control, rotation, guides and overlays are supported.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/tethering/live-view/","tags":null,"title":"live view"},{"categories":null,"content":"Create areas or locations and organize them as hierarchical tags.\nA location is shown as a shape on the map when selected.

These are the same as in the drawn mask interface of the processing modules.\nThe panel below these buttons displays a list of all masks and individual shapes defined for the current image.\nGroups of shapes forming a drawn mask are displayed with a headline in the form \u0026ldquo;group \u0026lt;module_name\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; to indicate the module in which they are used, with the constituent shapes listed below. The list of mask groups is followed by a list of all individual shapes that have been generated in the context of the current image (which also repeats the shapes that are part of a group). If a shape is in use by any drawn masks this is indicated by a symbol to the right of the shape name.\n🔗shapes By default each shape receives an automatically generated name, consisting of the shape type (\u0026ldquo;brush\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;circle\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;ellipse\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;path\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;gradient\u0026rdquo;) and an automatically-incremented integer. You can rename a shape by double-clicking on its current name. It is a good habit to give shapes and groups meaningful names, especially if you intend to reuse the same selection in different masks.\nIf any shape has a reduced opacity this will be shown to the right of the shape name. An icon representing the chosen set operator (mode) is shown to the left (except for the first shape in a group, which has no prior shape to be combined with).\nClick on a shape name to show the selected shape on the image canvas with all of its controls, allowing you to edit the properties of just that shape. This is especially useful where there are many overlapping shapes within a mask, making it difficult to select the right one with the mouse. Similarly if you select a shape on-screen from within the mask controls of a processing module, that shape will also be selected in the mask manager.\nRight-click on a shape name to show a menu containing additional options (explained below).\nNote: darktable retains all shapes that have ever been defined for the current image unless you explicitly remove them. If you choose to include develop history when exporting an image, all defined shapes will be exported with the image. Beware that if the list of shapes is very long the space required to store those shapes might exceed the size limit of certain file formats. This can cause XMP tag creation to fail during export.\n🔗masks \u0026amp; groups Drawn masks are constructed by adding a group of shapes to the image in the order that they are listed (from bottom to top \u0026ndash; the same order as processing modules are displayed). Each shape adjusts the existing mask using one of five logical set operators (see below). Because order is important it is also possible to move shapes up and down the list via the right-click menu.\nClick on the name of a group in the mask manager to expand that group, showing a list of its constituent shapes \u0026ndash; the corresponding shapes will be shown on the center image. Similarly if you choose to show a drawn mask from within a processing module, the corresponding group will be expanded within the mask manager.\nRight-click on a group name to display a menu with options to add new or existing shapes to the group, or to clean up unused shapes.

The currently-selected mode is highlighted with a check mark. move up/down Move the shape up or down the list. You can also create your own groups using existing shapes by selecting the shapes you wish to group, right-clicking them and choosing \u0026ldquo;group the forms\u0026rdquo;.\n🔗properties Expand the properties section to change the properties (opacity, size, rotation, feather, hardness) of the currently selected shape(s).\nIf a group is selected, the soft limits of the sliders are automatically adjusted in an attempt to prevent irreversible distortions (where some of the shapes are clamped at their extreme values but others can still be adjusted, so that reversing the move does not return all shapes to their previous configuration). However, like any soft limits, these can be overridden (forced) if you are happy to accept the consequences.\nIf a pen (e.g. Wacom) is detected, some additional options are also displayed to control how it is used by darktable:\npressure Controls how the pressure reading of a graphics tablet impacts newly generated drawn mask brush strokes. You can control the brush width, hardness and opacity. “Absolute” control means that the pressure reading directly defines the attribute with a value between 0% and 100%. “Relative” means that the pressure reading adjusts the attribute between zero and the pre-defined default value (default off). smoothing Sets the level for smoothing of drawn mask brush strokes. Stronger smoothing leads to fewer nodes and easier editing at the expense of lower accuracy. 🔗set operators (modes) Set operators are used to define how grouped shapes are combined. In the following examples (with the exception of \u0026ldquo;sum\u0026rdquo;) we will use a mask that combines a gradient followed by a path, to demonstrate the effect of each set operator when applied to the path shape:\nAs a convention in the following explanations we say that a pixel is \u0026ldquo;selected\u0026rdquo; in a mask or shape if it has an opacity greater than zero.\nsum (default for brush shapes) The shape adds to the existing mask by increasing its opacity by the opacity of the drawn shape. This allows multiple shapes (e.g. brush strokes) with low opacity to be layered on top of one another to increase the strength of the overall mask (e.g. for dodge and burn operations). The resulting opacity of a given pixel is the sum of the opacity of the individual shapes that intersect with that pixel, up to a maximum of 100%. union (default for non-brush shapes) The shape adds to the existing mask in such a way that the resulting mask contains the pixels that are either selected in the existing mask or in the added shape. In overlapping areas the maximum value is taken: intersection The shape adds to the existing mask in such a way that the resulting mask contains only pixels that are selected in both the existing mask and the added shape. In overlapping areas the minimum value is used. In the given example we use this operator to “imprint” the path with a gradient: difference In the non-overlapping area the existing mask is unchanged. In the resulting mask, pixels are selected only if they are selected in the existing mask but not in the added shape. This set operator can be chosen if you want to “cut out” a region from within an existing selection: exclusion The resulting mask selects all pixels that are selected in the existing mask and not in the added shape or vice versa.

The buttons on the left-hand-side are used to choose the display mode, from left-to-right: vectorscope, waveform, rgb parade and histogram. The buttons on the right-hand-side control how the plot for the current scope is drawn.\nThe height of the scopes module can be changed by clicking-and-dragging on the bottom edge or by holding down Shift+Alt while scrolling the mouse. The visibility of the module can be toggled with a keyboard shortcut (default Ctrl+Shift+H).\nThe scopes module is at the top of the right-hand panel by default but can be moved to the left-hand panel with preferences \u0026gt; miscellaneous \u0026gt; position of the scopes module.\nFor performance reasons, scopes are calculated from the image preview (the image displayed in the navigation module) rather than the higher quality image displayed in the center view. The preview is calculated at a lower resolution and may use shortcuts to bypass more time-consuming image processing steps. Hence the display may not accurately represent fine detail in the image, and may deviate in other ways from the final developed image.\n🔗histogram The histogram shows the distribution of pixels by lightness for each color channel.\nThe horizontal axis runs from 0% to 100% lightness for each channel. The vertical axis gives the count of pixels having the given lightness.\nIn its default state, data for all three RGB color channels is displayed. The red, green and blue colored buttons on the right-hand-side can be used to toggle the display of each color channel.\nThe first button on the right-hand-side toggles between logarithmic and linear rendering of the vertical axis (pixel count) data.\n🔗waveform The waveform scope shows similar data to the histogram, but allows you to view that data in a spatial context.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; horizontal waveform, the horizontal axis of the waveform represents the horizontal axis of the image \u0026ndash; the right-hand side of the waveform represents the right-hand side of the image and the left-hand side of the waveform represents the left-hand side of the image.\nThe vertical axis represents the distribution of pixels by lightness for each channel \u0026ndash; the dotted line at the top represents 100% lightness (values above this may be clipped), the dotted line in the middle represents 50% lightness, and the bottom of the waveform represents 0% lightness.\nThe brightness of each point on the waveform represents the number of pixels at the given position (the horizontal axis) having the given lightness (the vertical axis). The brighter the point, the more pixels at that position have that lightness.\nAs with the histogram, you can selectively display each of the red, green, and blue channels, by clicking on the appropriate buttons.\nThe first button on the right-hand-side toggles the display between horizontal (above) and vertical (below) mode:\nIn the vertical waveform, the vertical axis of the plot represents the vertical axis of the image, and the horizontal axis represents the distribution of pixels by lightness. The vertical waveform can be useful for portrait-format images, or simply to understand an image in a different way.\nSee Of Histograms and Waveforms for more on darktable\u0026rsquo;s waveform scope.\n🔗rgb parade The RGB parade scope shows the same data as the waveform, but with the red, green, and blue channels presented side-by-side.\nAs with the waveform, clicking the button on the right-hand-side of the module toggles between horizontal (above) and vertical (below) mode:\nThe RGB parade can be useful for matching the intensities of the red, green, and blue channels. It can also help to understand the differences between, and individual qualities of, each channel.\n🔗vectorscope The vectorscope shows chromaticity without regard to either lightness or spatial data.\nThe distance from the center of the graph represents chroma and the angle represents hue. Areas of the graph are colored depending on the chromaticity of the color to which they correspond in the image. The graph represents color \u0026ldquo;volume\u0026rdquo; by rendering the more frequently used colors in lighter tones.\nThe graph includes a \u0026ldquo;hue ring\u0026rdquo; representing the maximum chroma of each hue (in bounded RGB) of the current histogram profile. The RGB primary/secondary colors are marked by circles around the edge of the hue ring.\n🔗color harmony and additional vectorscope controls The vectorscope provides some additional controls beyond those provided by the other modes, which deserve separate discussion. Hovering over the scopes module while in vectorscope mode shows the following additional buttons:\nClick the right-most button to toggle the chroma scale between linear and logarithmic mode.\nClick the second-to-right-most button to toggle the color space of the vectorscope between CIELUV, JzAzBz or RYB \u0026ndash; as previously mentioned, these color spaces exclude any luminosity component in this module. The CIELUV graph will be faster to calculate, and is a well-known standard, though JzAzBz may be more perceptually accurate.\nFinally, along the left-hand edge of the module are a series of buttons that allow the selected color harmony indicator to be overlaid on the vectorscope graphic when in RYB color space. For example, the following shows the \u0026ldquo;triad\u0026rdquo; color harmony:\nRotate the display of the overlaid harmony guides by hovering over the scopes module and scrolling with the mouse scroll wheel. Hold Ctrl while scrolling to rotate more slowly. Hold Shift while scrolling to change the area covered by the guide overlays.\nThe type and position of the chosen harmony guides is saved alongside each image\u0026rsquo;s editing data (in the XMP file and database) so can be restored whenever you return to the image for further editing.\nA full description of how to use this functionality is out of scope of this reference section, however, the following overview gives a basic guide as to how to use this mode to improve the color harmonies within the image.\nWith the global color picker, take live samples of the key colored areas of the image. The choice of these is purely artistic, depending on the feeling you wish to convey. Choose (in the global color picker) to display the chosen samples on the RYB vectorscope.\nChoose the color harmony type that you wish to implement (or the closest to the actual distribution of picked live samples). Rotate (with Ctrl+scroll) until the picked samples fall roughly inside (or near) the harmony guides.\nIf some of the picked samples fall outside of the guide lines, perform manipulations of the image\u0026rsquo;s colors until they fall within the guides. You can use any processing module to achieve this but multiple masked instances of color balance rgb usually provide the best results.\nBear in mind that these controls are provided as a basic guide to achieving color harmony \u0026ndash; do not try to force colors into the guides at the expense of the overall look of the image. For some useful examples of how to use this functionality, please see the pull request that implemented the original change.\n🔗caveats The hue ring is not a gamut check, as a color can be within the hue ring, yet out of gamut due to its darkness/lightness. When adjusting an image based upon a color checker, faster and more accurate results will come from using calibrate with a color checker in the color calibration module. The vectorscope does not have a \u0026ldquo;skin tone line\u0026rdquo;, which is a flawed generalization rather than a universal standard. The vectorscope represents a colorimetric encoding of an image, which inevitably diverges from a viewer\u0026rsquo;s perception of the image. 🔗exposure adjustment The histogram, waveform, and RGB parade scopes can be used to directly alter the exposure and black level of the exposure module.\nFor the histogram, click towards the right-hand side of the histogram and then drag right to increase or drag left to decrease the exposure. In a similar manner you can control the black level by clicking and dragging in the left-hand side.\nFor horizontal waveform and RGB parade, drag the upper portion of the scope up/down to increase/decrease exposure. Drag the lower portion up/down to increase/decrease the black level.\nFor vertical waveform and RGB parade scopes, the corresponding regions are to the right (exposure) and left (black level).\nYou can also scroll in the appropriate area \u0026ndash; rather than dragging \u0026ndash; to adjust exposure and black point.\nFinally, you can override the default adjustment behavior as follows:\nhold Ctrl+Shift while adjusting to override the soft limits (e.g. to significantly overexpose the image) hold Ctrl while adjusting to fine-tune the adjustment. Alternatively, right-click to enter a precise value for the adjustment double-click on the desired area to reset to the original value 🔗histogram profile Image data is converted to the histogram profile before the scope data is calculated. You can choose this profile by right-clicking on the soft-proof or gamut check icons in the bottom module and then selecting the profile of interest. When soft-proof or gamut check is enabled, the scope is shown in the soft proof profile.\nAs the scopes module runs at the end of the preview pixelpipe, it receives data in display color space. If you are using a display color space that is not \u0026ldquo;well behaved\u0026rdquo; (this is common for a device profile), then colors that are outside of the gamut of the display profile may be clipped or distorted.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/dtdocs/en/module-reference/utility-modules/shared/scopes/","tags":null,"title":"scopes"},{"categories":null,"content":"Select images in the lighttable according to simple criteria.\n🔗module controls select all Select all images in the current collection. select none De-select all images. invert selection Select all images in the current collection that are not currently selected. select film roll Select all images in the current collection that are in the same film roll as the currently-selected images. select untouched Select all images in the current collection that have not yet been developed.

A tag can also be detached if you right click on the tag name and select detach from the pop-up menu. hidden tags Choose whether to view any hidden tags that darktable has automatically attached to the selected images. sort Choose whether to sort the attached tags list alphabetically or by the count shown in brackets next to the tag (this count indicates how many of the selected images have that tag attached to them). parents Choose whether or not to show the parent categories of the tag. You can adjust the height of the attached tags window by holding Ctrl and scrolling with your mouse wheel.\n🔗tag dictionary section The tag dictionary section displays all of the tags that are available in darktable\u0026rsquo;s database. At the top of the tag dictionary section is a text box where tag names can be entered. Below this is a list of available tags, which may also include indicator symbols to the left of the tag names. The meanings of these symbols are as follows:\na check mark [✓] indicates that the tag is attached to all of the selected images\na minus sign [\u0026ndash;] indicates that the tag is attached to at least one of the selected images. If the symbol is next to a node name in the hierarchical tree view, it means that one of the child tags under that node is attached to at least one of the selected images.\nif no indicator symbol is present, this means that the tag is not attached to any of the selected images, or that the node has no child tags attached to any of the selected images.\nIn the hierarchical tree view, a name in italics represents either a free node or a category.\nBelow the tag dictionary list are the following buttons, from left to right:\nnew Create a new tag, using the name that has been entered into the text entry box at the top of the tag dictionary section. import\u0026hellip; Import tags from a Lightroom keyword file. export\u0026hellip; Export all tags to a Lightroom keyword file. suggestions Show a list of suggested keywords based on the keywords already associated with the selected images (see the preferences section). CAUTION: This view queries the database so might be slow. list/tree Toggle the display of tags between the straight list view and hierarchical tree view. You can adjust the height of the tag dictionary window by holding Ctrl while scrolling with your mouse wheel.\n🔗usage The following sections describe the operations that can be performed with tags.\n🔗text entry The text entry box (shown under the attach/detach buttons) has multiple purposes.\nIf the tag dictionary list is in list view mode (rather than tree view mode), then typing the first few characters of a tag will bring up a list of suggestions. You can then scroll down with the arrow keys and press Enter to select one of the suggestions. Pressing Enter a second time will attach it to the selected images. You can also edit the name of the tag before pressing Enter \u0026ndash; in this case the tag will be created if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist in the database.\nTyping some partial text into the text entry box allows you filters the set of tags shown in the tag dictionary window to those whose name or synonym matches the entered text. Press Enter to attach a tag with the entered name to the selected images. If that tag name does not yet exist in the database, it will be created before being attached.\nThe pop-up menu entry “copy to entry” can be used to copy a selected tag to the text entry box. You can then edit this name and press Enter to create a new tag with that name, making it easy to create multiple tags with similar names.\n🔗create tag There are several ways to create a new tag:\nImport a text file. You can import one or more text files in the Lightroom tagging file format. You can also export your tags, edit the exported file, then re-import it. The import function updates existing tags and creates new tags as required. If you change the name of a tag in an imported file, it will be treated as a new tag.\nImport already-tagged images. This method does not offer any flexibility to change tag names or categories during the import process.\nUse the “create tag” sub-menu. A tag can be created manually, under an existing one (hierarchical) or at the root level.\nUse the “set as a tag“ sub-menu. You can set a free node (e.g. ”places|England”) as a tag so that it gets implicitly attached to all images tagged with its sub-tags (e.g. ”places|England|London”).\nType into the text box and press the “new” button or the Enter key. Hierarchical tags are created using the pipe symbol “|” to separate nodes. Note that the entered tag is also attached to any selected images.\nA number of tags are automatically generated by darktable when certain actions are undertaken. For example, the tags “darktable|exported” and “darktable|styles|your_style” can be used to identify images that have been exported and had styles applied, respectively.\n🔗edit/rename tag The tag dictionary can be maintained via the \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;change path\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; items in the right-click pop-up menu.\nThe \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; operation allows you to change the name of a tag, though you cannot change which node it belongs to (you cannot use the pipe \u0026ldquo;|\u0026rdquo; symbol in the tag name field). The command is aborted if you try to enter a tag name that already exists. You can set the private and category flags and define synonyms for the tag (see below). These attributes are recorded in the XMP-dc Subject and XMP-lr Hierarchical Subject metadata entries, respectively. You can control which tags are included in exports by changing settings in the export module.\nA tag set as “private” is, by default, not exported.\nA tag set as “category” is not exported in XMP-dc Subject. However it is exported in XMP-lr Hierarchical Subject as this XMP metadata holds the organization of your tags.\n“synonyms” enrich the tag information and are mainly used to assist search engines. For example “juvenile”, “kid” or “youth” can be set as synonyms of “child”. Synonyms can also be used to translate tag names to other languages.\nThe \u0026ldquo;change path\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; operation is only available in the tree view mode, and it shows the number of tagged images which would be impacted by a change to the name of this node. The change path window lets the user change the full path of the node, including the nodes to which it belongs (nodes can be specified using the pipe \u0026ldquo;|\u0026rdquo; symbol). This operation is powerful, but please take care as it can have a significant impact on the metadata of your images. The operation is aborted if the requested change causes a conflict with an existing tag.\nA quick way to organize the tag structure is to drag and drop the nodes. In the tree view mode, you can drag any node and drop it on top of any other node. The first node and its descendants, if any, become descendants of the second node. Dragging over a node automatically opens that node (to avoid opening a node, drag over the node selection indicator instead). To place a node at the root level, drag it onto the top of the tagging window. If the requested change causes a conflict with an existing tag, the operation is aborted.\n🔗attach tag There are a number of ways to attach an existing tag to a group of selected images:\nclick on a tag in the tag dictionary window to select it, then click on the attach button. right-click on a tag in the tag dictionary window, to show a pop-up menu, then select the “attach tag” menu item. double-click on a tag in the tag dictionary window. right-click on a tag shown in the attached tags view to show a pop-up menu. If some of the selected images do not currently have that tag, the \u0026ldquo;attach tag to all\u0026rdquo; menu item can be used to attach that tag to all the selected images. Type into the text box and press the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; button or the Enter key. This will create the tag if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist, and attach it to the selected images. Press Ctrl+T to open a small text box at the bottom of the central view of the lighttable. Type in the name of a tag and press Enter. The tag will be created if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, and attached to all the selected images. Drag an image or group of images and drop it onto the desired tag. When hovering over the images in the lighttable you can check which tags are attached to the image, either by looking at the attached tags window in the tagging module, or in the tags attribute in the image information module.\n🔗detach tag There are several ways to remove a tag from a group of selected images:\nclick on a tag in the attached tag window of the tagging module to select the tag, then click on the detach button. double-click on a tag in the attached tag window. right-click on a tag in the attached tag window, to show a pop-up menu, and select \u0026ldquo;detach\u0026rdquo;. 🔗delete tag It is possible to completely remove a tag from all images (whether selected or not) and delete the tag from the database. Because this could impact a large number of images, a warning will be displayed indicating how many images currently have this tag attached. Take this warning seriously as there is no way to undo this action (except by restoring your database and/or XMP sidecar files from a backup). A tag in tag dictionary window can be deleted in the following ways:\nright-click on a tag in the tag dictionary window, to show a pop-up menu, and choose \u0026ldquo;delete tag\u0026rdquo;. right-click on a branch node in the tag dictionary window, to show a pop-up menu, and choose \u0026ldquo;delete node\u0026rdquo; to delete the selected node together with any child nodes. 🔗import / export The “import” button allows you to choose a text file (which must comply with the Lightroom tag text file format) and import its content. If a tag in the imported file already exists, its properties will be updated, otherwise a new tag will be created.\nThe “export” button exports your entire tag dictionary into a text file of your choice (Lightroom tag text file format).\n🔗copy tag to clipboard It is possible to copy a single selected tag to the clipboard from both attached tags and tag dictionary sections by using the pop-up menu entry \u0026ldquo;copy to clipboard\u0026rdquo;.\n🔗find tag If you right-click on a tag name in the attached tags section and click find tag, then the tag dictionary will show all matching tags.\n🔗keyboard The following keys can be used within the tagging module:\nThe Tab key can be used to navigate between the attached tags view, the text entry box, and the tag dictionary view. Pressing Tab from within the text entry field selects the first matching tag in the tag dictionary view (if any).\nThe Down arrow key is equivalent to the Tab key, when pressed while inside the text entry field.\nShift+Tab does the same as the Tab key but navigates in the opposite direction. Pressing Shift+Tab from within the text entry field selects the first user tag in the attached tags view (if any).\nThe Enter key can be used within the tag dictionary view to attach the selected tag, keeping focus on the attached tag (similar to when a tag is attached using the mouse).\nPressing Shift+Enter from within the tag dictionary view returns focus to the text entry field.\nThe Delete / BackSpace keys can be used within the attached tags view to detach the selected tag.\n🔗navigation To see the images bearing a particular tag in the tag dictionary window, right-click on the tag name and choose \u0026ldquo;go to tag collection\u0026rdquo; in the resulting pop-up menu. This opens a collection in the collections module showing all images containing this tag. You can also select other tags in the collections module by double-clicking on the collection for the other tag.\nTo return to the collection that was selected before opening a tag collection select the \u0026ldquo;go back to work\u0026rdquo; item from the pop-up menu. This will allow you to return to the original collection, as long as you haven\u0026rsquo;t selected any other collections in the meantime.\n🔗preferences The \u0026ldquo;preferences…\u0026rdquo; option in the presets menu brings up a dialog where you can tweak the behavior of the tag suggestions list. The tag suggestions list comprises two parts, with the best-matched tags on one side and the most-recently-attached tags on the other. The following options are available:\nsuggested tags level of confidence Level of confidence used to include the tag in the suggestions list (default 50): 0: display all associated tags, 99: match tags with a 99% confidence level, 100: this is essentially an unreachable level of confidence and so returns no matching tags. Use 100% to disable the best-matched tag suggestion list (faster). number of recently attached tags Number of recently attached tags to include in the suggestions list (default 20). A value of \u0026ldquo;-1\u0026rdquo; can be used to disable the most-recently-attached suggestions list.
