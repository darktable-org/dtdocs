    </h1>

    

    <p><em>Shortcuts</em> are a way to control darktable using your keyboard, mouse, trackpad, or other <em>input devices</em>, such as MIDI and game controllers (as detailed in the <a href="/dtdocs/en/special-topics/midi-device-support/">midi device support</a> section). They allow you to perform <em>actions</em> without interacting directly with a UI element.</p>
<p>An <em>action</em> is usually an operation that you might undertake using darktable&rsquo;s point-and-click user interface.
See <a href="#common-actions">common actions</a> for a list of the most common ones. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase, decrease or reset sliders</li>
<li>Scroll through dropdown lists</li>
<li>Enable, expand or focus modules</li>
<li>Click buttons</li>
<li>Switch between views</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended way to assign shortcuts to visual elements is the <a href="#visual-shortcut-mapping">visual shortcut mapping</a> mode.</p>
<h1 id="in-a-nutshell"><a href="#in-a-nutshell">🔗</a>in a nutshell</h1>
<p>If you just want to assign a specific key to toggle a button, the process is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the 








<a href="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/visual-mapping-button.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/visual-mapping-button.png" alt="visual mapping button"  class="icon"    /></a>

 icon in the <a href="/dtdocs/en/overview/user-interface/top-panel/">top panel</a></li>
<li>Hover the button that you want to control</li>
<li>Press the key that you want to use to control the button</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, to control a slider with a shortcut you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the 








<a href="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/visual-mapping-button.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/visual-mapping-button.png" alt="visual mapping button"  class="icon"    /></a>

 icon</li>
<li>Hover the slider that you want to control</li>
<li>Press the key that you want to use to control the slider, and scroll the mouse wheel or move the mouse horizontally, vertically or diagonally</li>
</ol>
<p>The system is very flexible and powerful, and this is just scratching the surface.
Keep on reading to understand it better and learn how to make the most of it.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-shortcuts-and-actions"><a href="#types-of-shortcuts-and-actions">🔗</a>types of shortcuts and actions</h1>
<p>There are two types of actions:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>Discrete</em> actions</dt>
<dd>E.g., executing a command, focusing a UI element or resetting a slider</dd>
<dt><em>Directional actions</em></dt>
<dd>E.g., adjusting the value of a slider or scrolling through a list of presets</dd>
</dl>
<p>As the two action types are inherently different, so are the shortcuts you can use to trigger them:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Discrete actions</em> can be triggered by <em>discrete shortcuts</em> consisting only of key presses and optionally mouse clicks</li>
<li><em>Directional actions</em> need also a direction (and, in the case of sliders, a magnitude). Hence, the corresponding <em>directional shortcuts</em> will also incorporate a mouse movement</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key <code>e</code> can be used to focus a module, or to toggle it on/off</li>
<li>The key <code>e</code>, combined with up/down movements or the mouse, can be used to control the value of a slider</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
A <em>directional shortcut</em> is sufficient to trigger a <em>discrete action</em>. The opposite is not true. However, it is possible to use a combination of two <em>discrete shortcuts</em> to control a <em>directional action</em>. For example, you can use two different shortcuts to trigger the <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> effects of a slider (see <a href="#anatomy-of-an-action">anatomy of an action</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are using keyboard and mouse, <strong>all shortcuts must start with one or more key presses</strong>, as mouse actions in isolation are used to navigate and interact with the UI.</p>
<p>If you have an input device, you can trigger discrete actions by pressing one or more buttons on the controller. Directional actions can use a combination of buttons and a knob/joystick movement, or just knob/joystick movement.</p>
<h1 id="anatomy-of-a-shortcut"><a href="#anatomy-of-a-shortcut">🔗</a>anatomy of a shortcut</h1>
<p>The simplest shortcut consists of just one key press (e.g., <code>e</code>).</p>
<p>The same key can be repeated up to three times, so also <code>e double-press</code> (i.e., <code>e</code> pressed and released twice in quick succession) and <code>e triple-press</code> (i.e., <code>e</code> pressed and released three times in quick succession) are valid, and distinct, shortcuts.</p>
<p>You can further extend a shortcut with up to three clicks of different mouse buttons. So, <code>e double-press + left click</code> or <code>e + right click + left click</code> are also valid shortcuts.</p>
<p>Finally, if your fingers are very nimble and you really need to go there, you can repeat the last click up to three times. So, also <code>e + left click + middle double-click</code> and <code>e double press + middle click + left click + right triple-click</code> are valid shortcuts.</p>
<p>Hence, the most complex shortcut can consist of 8 key/button presses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three key presses of the same key, (e.g., <code>e</code>), followed by</li>
<li>Three presses of the three mouse buttons, followed by</li>
<li>2 more repetitions of the last click.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your shortcut can include one or more modifiers (<code>shift</code>, <code>ctrl</code> and <code>alt</code>). In this case, for a directional shortcut, both the last key and the modifier must be pressed down when you execute the movement. For example, <code>ctrl + e double-press + pan</code> means that while moving the mouse left and/or right both  <code>e</code> and <code>ctrl</code> must be pressed down.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
If you are a macOS user, your shortcuts will use <code>cmd</code> instead of <code>ctrl</code> and <code>option</code> instead of <code>alt</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are defining a directional shortcut, then the movement part of the shortcut must be executed while the last key, mouse or controller button is held down.</p>
<p>For example, the shortcut <code>e double-press + pan</code>, can be activated by pressing <code>e</code> twice, holding down <code>e</code> on the second press and moving the mouse horizontally while the key is pressed.</p>
<h2 id="short-and-long-presses"><a href="#short-and-long-presses">🔗</a>short and long presses</h2>
<p>By default, all key presses and button clicks in a shortcut are <em>short</em>, i.e., the key/button is pressed and immediately released. However, the last repetition of a key/button press in a shortcut can also be a <em>long</em> one.
You can turn a normal key/button press into a long press by simply holding it a little longer before releasing it (longer than double-click speed but shorter than twice double-click speed). This applies to key presses and mouse clicks alike.
Hence <code>e double-press</code> and <code>e long double-press</code> are two distinct shortcuts that can be assigned to different actions. The associated action triggers when the key is released, which entails that a shortcut ending with a long press cannot be used for a directional shortcut.</p>
<h2 id="movements-in-directional-shortcuts"><a href="#movements-in-directional-shortcuts">🔗</a>movements in directional shortcuts</h2>
<p>The following movements are supported when defining directional shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement of the mouse scroll wheel</li>
<li>Horizontal, vertical or diagonal movement of the mouse cursor</li>
<li>Movement of a knob/joystick on an input device</li>
</ul>
<p>When using an input device, you can directly assign a control knob or joystick to an action. However, this will significantly reduce the flexibility of such devices, as you will be able to use the knob/joystick only to control one action. By prefixing the movement with a key or button press you can use the same knob/joystick to control multiple actions.</p>
<h2 id="triggering-multiple-shortcuts-at-once"><a href="#triggering-multiple-shortcuts-at-once">🔗</a>triggering multiple shortcuts at once</h2>
<p>If both <code>e + scroll</code> and <code>f + scroll</code> are mapped to a slider (or if you have fallbacks enabled), then scrolling the mouse wheel while holding down both <code>e</code> and <code>f</code> will move both sliders.
Similarly, you could map <code>e double-press + scroll</code> and <code>f double-press + scroll</code> to two nodes in a graph (say, <code>yellow</code> and <code>green</code> in color equalizer). You can then move both sliders at once by:</p>
<ol>
<li>pressing and releasing <code>e</code> once;</li>
<li>pressing and holding <code>e</code>;</li>
<li>pressing and holding <code>f</code>;</li>
<li>using the scroll wheel while both <code>e</code> and <code>f</code> are pressed.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works because the repeat key counter is per-shortcut, not per key, and it is reset only after the current shortcut ends (i.e., when the repeated key is released). Thus it is possible to trigger as many actions at once as your fingers can handle, provided that all the shortcuts involved have the same number of key presses (i.e., single, double or triple presses).</p>
<h2 id="shortcuts-must-be-unique-within-a-view"><a href="#shortcuts-must-be-unique-within-a-view">🔗</a>shortcuts must be unique within a view</h2>
<p>A single action may have multiple shortcuts but a single shortcut can only be linked to one action in a given darktable view &ndash; you can&rsquo;t chain actions together except by applying a preset or style. You can, however, set up a single shortcut that does one thing in the lighttable view and another in the darkroom view.</p>
<h2 id="additional-modifiers"><a href="#additional-modifiers">🔗</a>additional modifiers</h2>
<p>The only valid modifiers are the <code>shift</code>, <code>ctrl</code> and <code>alt</code> keys on the keyboard. You can assign any key (or input device buttons) to function as one of the existing modifier types by assigning keys/buttons to the &ldquo;global/modifier&rdquo; action. However, you cannot define new modifier types.</p>
<h1 id="anatomy-of-an-action"><a href="#anatomy-of-an-action">🔗</a>anatomy of an action</h1>
<p><em>Actions</em> apply an <em>effect</em> to an <em>element</em> of a <em>widget</em>, where these terms are defined as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>widget</dt>
<dd>Each visible part of the user interface is a <em>widget</em>. For example, the darktable application window is a widget, containing side panel widgets, each of which contains module widgets, each of which contains button, slider and dropdown list widgets etc. When assigning a shortcut to an action, you must first decide which widget it will apply to.</dd>
<dt>element</dt>
<dd>An <em>element</em> is the part of a UI widget that is affected by your shortcut. For example, for a slider that has a <a href="/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/module-controls/#pickers">picker</a>, you can make a shortcut activate the picker <em>button</em> element or change the <em>value</em> element of the slider. For a row of tabs (the row is a single widget) you can select which tab element to activate or use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll through the tabs.</dd>
<dt>effect</dt>
<dd>A shortcut can sometimes have multiple possible <em>effects</em> on a given <em>element</em>. For example, a button can be activated as if it was pressed with a plain mouse-click or as if it was pressed with Ctrl+click. A slider&rsquo;s value can be edited, increased/decreased or reset.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, you can assign the shortcut <code>e + scroll</code> to change the value (the <em>effect</em>) of the exposure slider (the <em>element</em>) of the exposure correction <em>widget</em>.</p>
<h1 id="assigning-shortcuts-to-actions"><a href="#assigning-shortcuts-to-actions">🔗</a>assigning shortcuts to actions</h1>
<p>There are two primary methods of assigning shortcuts to actions: <a href="#visual-shortcut-mapping">visual shortcut mapping</a> (recommended) and the <a href="#shortcut-mapping-screen">shortcut mapping screen</a>. The former makes it easier to remap multiple shortcuts at once, while the latter allows for finer control and more flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="visual-shortcut-mapping"><a href="#visual-shortcut-mapping">🔗</a>visual shortcut mapping</h2>

 icon in the <a href="/dtdocs/en/overview/user-interface/top-panel/">top panel</a> of any darktable view to enter visual shortcut mapping mode. If you hold Ctrl while clicking the button, no confirmation will appear when overwriting an existing shortcut mapping.</p>
<p>The mouse cursor will change as you hover over UI widgets, to indicate whether or not a mapping can be created:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To define new shortcuts:</strong>
Press a key combination while hovering over a mappable widget. A <em>default action</em> will be assigned to that shortcut based on the type of widget and whether it is directional. See the <a href="#common-actions">common actions</a> section for examples of some of the defaults.
You can assign as many shortcuts as you like in a single mapping session and then exit mapping mode when you are finished by clicking the 








<a href="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/visual-mapping-button.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/visual-mapping-button.png" alt="visual mapping button"  class="icon"    /></a>

 icon again or right-clicking anywhere on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>To explore already defined shortcuts:</strong>
Left-click on a mappable widget to open the shortcut mapping screen for that widget (see below). Left-click anywhere else on the screen to open the shortcut mapping screen, expanded (where possible) based on the part of the screen you have clicked on. This screen can be used to alter the action assigned to a shortcut and to configure shortcuts for non-visual actions. Entering the shortcut mapping screen exits visual shortcut mapping mode.</p>
<p><strong>To update existing shortcuts:</strong>
Define a second shortcut against the same widget. If you attempt to reallocate an existing shortcut to a new action, you will be notified of the conflict and prompted to replace the existing shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>To change the default speed of a slider:</strong>
Scroll with your mouse wheel while in visual mapping mode (without pressing any other buttons/keys) when hovering over the slider &ndash; scroll up to increase and down to decrease. When you leave mapping mode, normal mouse scrolls over that slider will change its value with the adjusted speed.</p>
<h2 id="shortcut-mapping-screen"><a href="#shortcut-mapping-screen">🔗</a>shortcut mapping screen</h2>
<p>The shortcut mapping screen can be accessed from the global preferences dialog or by right-clicking on the visual mapping button. This screen allows access to all available actions, including some that are not directly linked to a UI widget.</p>
<p>The top panel of the shortcut mapping screen shows a list of available UI widgets/actions and the bottom panel shows the shortcuts currently assigned to them. Fields that can be changed by user action are shown in bold.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
You can search the top and bottom panels using the text entry boxes at the bottom of the screen, and use the up/down arrow keys to navigate between matches.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>To create a new shortcut for an item:</strong>
Double-click an item in the top panel, and then enter your desired shortcut (right-click to cancel). Once you have done this, a new entry will appear in the bottom panel showing the shortcut you have created. You can then manually alter the <em>element</em>, <em>effect</em>, <em>speed</em> or <em>instance</em> of the assigned action against that shortcut in the bottom panel. To delete a user-defined shortcut, select it in the bottom panel and press the Delete key.</p>
<p>Selecting an existing shortcut in the bottom panel will highlight (in bold) the matching action and its parents in the top panel. You can use this to navigate the top panel and find related actions.</p>
<p>The following additional options are provided in the shortcut mapping screen:</p>
<dl>
<dt>export&hellip;</dt>
<dd>Export the current shortcut mappings for one or all of your devices (keyboard/mouse, midi, game controller) to an external file. The dialog will show you how many shortcuts exist for each device.</dd>
<dt>import extras</dt>
<dd>Import extended shortcuts from a system file (<code>shortcutsrc</code>, with an optional language suffix, from your darktable installation &ndash; not the local config file of the same name). Existing shortcuts matching any in the system file will be replaced. These shortcuts will be localized to your system language if a localized version of the system file is available &ndash; currently, only German (<code>shortcutsrc.de</code>) in addition to the default English.</dd>
<dt>import&hellip;</dt>
<dd>Import shortcut mappings from an external file for one or all of your devices. When loading a device, you can chose to assign it a different number. This can for example be used to exchange midi layouts. Before loading, you can chose to wipe the specific device first. When loading all from an empty file, this will effectively delete all your shortcuts.</dd>
<dt>restore&hellip;</dt>
<dd>Restore your shortcut mappings to (a) The mappings shipped with darktable by default, (b) The start of your current session, or (c) The point at which the shortcut mapping screen was last opened. When restoring, you can choose to leave any additional shortcuts that were added after the relevant checkpoint as they are, so that only changed shortcuts are restored to their previous meaning. Or you can choose to first clear all shortcuts and just load the restore point.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="deleting-default-shortcuts"><a href="#deleting-default-shortcuts">🔗</a>deleting default shortcuts</h2>
<p>When you delete a shortcut that has been created by darktable by default, that shortcut is moved to a separate &ldquo;disabled defaults&rdquo; category, in order to prevent it from being reloaded the next time darktable is launched. To reinstate a deleted shortcut, simply delete the shortcut from that category. You will be prompted if reinstating this shortcut overwrites another one that has been created in the meantime.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may disable <a href="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/miscellaneous/">preferences &gt; miscellaneous &gt; interface &gt; load default shortcuts at startup</a> to prevent default shortcuts from being loaded on startup. While this option is disabled, darktable will only load user-defined shortcuts and any defaults that you have not subsequently deleted or overridden.</p>
<h1 id="common-actions"><a href="#common-actions">🔗</a>common actions</h1>
<p>The following is a list of some of the actions to which you can assign shortcuts, organized by widget type. This is not an exhaustive list and you are encouraged to browse the shortcut mapping screen for a complete list of available actions.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Some actions may have no effect. For example, all sliders include a <em>button</em> element, regardless of whether such a button is actually present alongside a given slider.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="global-actions"><a href="#global-actions">🔗</a>global actions</h2>
<p>Actions in the &ldquo;global&rdquo; section of the shortcut mapping screen can be executed from any darktable view. Most of these actions do not have specific <em>elements</em> as they are used to perform one-off operations.</p>
<p>For example, the predefined shortcut <code>tab</code> triggers the action <code>globals/panels/all</code>, which toggles the visibility of all the side panels in the current view.</p>
<h2 id="view-specific-actions"><a href="#view-specific-actions">🔗</a>view-specific actions</h2>
<p>Actions in the &ldquo;views&rdquo; section can only be executed from the specified darktable view. As with global actions, most do not have specific <em>elements</em> as they are used to perform one-off operations.</p>
<p>For example, the predefined shortcut <code>ctrl + b</code> triggers the action <code>views/darkroom/guide lines/toggle</code>, which toggles guide lines in the darktable view. It has an <code>effect</code> setting which allows you to directly simulate a right-click on the button, which in this case opens the guide lines configuration popup.</p>
<h2 id="actions-on-modules"><a href="#actions-on-modules">🔗</a>actions on modules</h2>
<p>All <em>utility</em> and <em>processing</em> modules have the following elements:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>show</em></dt>
<dd>Acts as a <em>toggle</em> that expands and collapses the module.</dd>
<dt><em>reset</em></dt>
<dd>Acts as a <em>button</em> that resets all module parameters when activated. The <em>ctrl-activate</em> action can be used to re-apply any automatic presets for that module.</dd>
<dt><em>presets</em></dt>
<dd>Allows you to select actions from the <a href="/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/presets/">presets</a> menu (e.g. edit, update, previous, next). The default action, when assigning a discrete shortcut to a <em>preset</em> element, is to display a list of the available presets for selection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a shortcut is assigned to a utility module, the default action is to <em>toggle</em> the <em>show</em> element (expand/collapse the module).</p>
<h3 id="processing-modules"><a href="#processing-modules">🔗</a>processing modules</h3>
<p>Additionally, processing modules have the following elements:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>enable</em></dt>
<dd>Acts as a <em>toggle</em> that switches the module on and off.</dd>
<dt><em>focus</em></dt>
<dd>Acts as a <em>toggle</em> that focuses or unfocuses the module. This is useful for modules such as <a href="/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/crop/"><em>crop</em></a> or <a href="/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/tone-equalizer/"><em>tone equalizer</em></a>, whose on-screen controls are only activated when those modules have focus. For <em>crop</em>, changes are saved only when the module loses focus.</dd>
<dt><em>instance</em></dt>
<dd>Allows you to select actions from the <a href="/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/multiple-instances/">multiple-instance</a> menu (e.g. move up/down, create new instance). The discrete action associated to the <em>instance</em> element displays a list of the available options for selection; a directional action is also available and will move the <em>preferred module instance</em> (see below) up and down the pixelpipe.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If an action affects a processing module that can have multiple instances, you can choose which instance to adjust with a given shortcut. By default, all actions will affect the &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; instance, as defined using the settings in <a href="/dtdocs/en/preferences-settings/miscellaneous/#shortcuts-with-multiple-instances">preferences &gt; miscellaneous &gt; shortcuts with multiple instances</a>.</p>
<p>Additional options are available in the shortcuts mapping screen to adjust the blend parameters (the &lt;blending&gt; section) and module controls (the &lt;focused&gt; section) for the currently-focused module. The latter section allows you to assign shortcuts to the first, second, third (etc.) button, drop-down, slider and tab on the module. The shortcuts will affect different module controls depending on which module currently has focus (as the available list of controls changes).</p>
<p>For example, you if you assign <code>' + scroll</code> to <code>processing modules/\&lt;focused\&gt;/sliders</code> and set <code>element</code> to <code>1st</code>, you will be able to use the scroll wheel while holding down <code>'</code> to adjust the value of the first slider of the currently focused module. If <code>exposure</code> is focused you will affect the <code>exposure correction</code> slider, if <code>denoise (profiled)</code> is focused you will affect the <code>denoising strength</code> slider.</p>
<h2 id="actions-on-specific-widget-types"><a href="#actions-on-specific-widget-types">🔗</a>actions on specific widget types</h2>
<h3 id="buttons"><a href="#buttons">🔗</a>buttons</h3>
<p>A button is a clickable icon in the darktable interface. The default action is to activate that button as if clicked with the left mouse button. You can modify this action to activate the button as if clicked while holding a modifier key.</p>
<h3 id="toggles"><a href="#toggles">🔗</a>toggles</h3>
<p>A toggle is a button that has a persistent on/off state. It therefore has additional <em>effects</em> to allow you to toggle it or explicitly set its state. As with a normal button, the default action is to activate the toggle as if clicked with the left mouse button (which toggles the button on/off).</p>
<p>For example, the predefined shortcut <code>shift + O</code> is associated to <code>views/darkroom/raw overexposed/toggle</code>, which toggles on/off the raw overexposure indicator in the darkroom.</p>
<h3 id="dropdowns"><a href="#dropdowns">🔗</a>dropdowns</h3>
<p>A dropdown is a multi-selection box and has the following elements available:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>selection</em></dt>
<dd>Allows values to be selected from the dropdown list in various ways. The default action, when assigning a discrete shortcut to a dropdown, is to display a popup <em>edit</em> box with a list of the available values for selection; A directional shortcut (i.e., including a mouse movement) will scroll through the available values.</dd>
<dt><em>button</em></dt>
<dd>A standard <em>button</em> element that allows the button to the right of the dropdown (if present) to be activated. For example, the <em>aspect</em> dropdown in the <a href="/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/crop/"><em>crop</em></a> module has a button that allows the crop controls to be changed from portrait to landscape and vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="sliders"><a href="#sliders">🔗</a>sliders</h3>
<p>A slider allows you to continuously alter an integer or decimal value, and has the following elements available:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>value</em></dt>
<dd>Allows the current value of the slider to be altered. The default action, when assigning a discrete shortcut to a slider, is to display a popup <em>edit</em> box so you can enter a value; A directional shortcut will change the value up and down. Value elements are also used for modifying some on-screen graphs. When modifying the <em>value</em> element with a shortcut you may not exceed the bounds set in the visual slider.</dd>
<dt><em>force</em></dt>
<dd>This is the same as the <em>value</em> element described above, but it allows you to exceed the bounds set in the visual slider.</dd>
<dt><em>zoom</em></dt>
<dd>Allows you to change the upper and lower bounds of the visual slider without altering the current value.</dd>
<dt><em>button</em></dt>
<dd>A standard <em>button</em> element that allows the button to the right of the slider (if present) to be activated. For example, a slider may include a <a href="/dtdocs/en/darkroom/processing-modules/module-controls/#pickers">picker</a> to visually set its value based on selected elements of the image.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can alter the value of a slider more quickly or slowly than normal by defining the <em>speed</em> of the action in the shortcut mapping screen. By default a <em>value</em> (or <em>force</em>) effect is given a speed of 1.0, which means that it is changed at the default rate defined by the given slider. You can alter the slider more quickly by increasing the speed (a speed of 10 makes the action 10x faster) or more slowly by decreasing it (a speed of 0.1 makes the action 10x slower).</p>
<h1 id="fallbacks-aka-generalized-shortcut-extensions"><a href="#fallbacks-aka-generalized-shortcut-extensions">🔗</a>fallbacks (a.k.a. generalized shortcut extensions)</h1>
<p>As discussed above, a <em>widget</em> can have multiple different <em>actions</em> applied to it, and you may want to set shortcuts to control several of them. For example, to toggle a module on/off, expand/collapse it, and reset it to its default state. Normally, this would require setting 3 shortcuts for each module. If you want to control 5 modules in this fashion, you have to define 15 shortcuts. Setting up all these shortcuts one by one can be tedious and error prone.</p>
<p>To make this process simpler and to ensure consistency across all modules, you can create a single discrete shortcut for each module and then have a number of effects made available by default as <em>extensions</em> to that shortcut. These <em>generalized shortcut extensions</em> are called shortcut <em>fallbacks</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Fallbacks are a powerful way to quickly set up multiple actions using predefined and consistent shortcuts. They will assign a lot of actions automatically, which may be confusing if you are not aware of them. Fallbacks are therefore <em>disabled</em> by default and you will need to click on the <code>enable fallbacks</code> check box in the shortcuts setup window to enable them.</p>
<hr>
<p>If they are enabled, when you create a discrete shortcut (e.g., <code>ctrl + r</code>) against a processing module the following shortcuts will be defined automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ctrl + r</code> to show/hide the module (the default fallback)</li>
<li><code>ctrl + r + left click</code> to enable/disable the module</li>
<li><code>ctrl + r + left double-click</code> to reset the module</li>
<li><code>ctrl + r + right click</code> to show the module&rsquo;s preset menu</li>
<li><code>ctrl + r + right double-click</code> to show the module&rsquo;s multiple instance menu</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case (except the first) you should hold the initial shortcut while clicking with your mouse. The final single/double mouse-click will apply the corresponding action.</p>
<p>Similar fallbacks are defined for many common UI elements.
As with any other shortcut, fallback settings are fully customizable.</p>
<p>To see a list of <em>all</em> of the default fallbacks, click the &ldquo;enable fallbacks&rdquo; checkbox in the shortcut mapping screen and select the &ldquo;fallbacks&rdquo; category in the top panel. To see the fallbacks for a given widget (e.g. a slider) just select that widget in the top panel. In both cases an additional item (also named &ldquo;fallbacks&rdquo;) will then appear in the bottom panel containing full details of the available fallbacks.</p>
<p>Fallbacks are only applied if no other shortcut using the resulting combination has been explicitly created. In the above example, if you were to explicitly assign <code>ctrl + r + left click</code> to another action, the &ldquo;enable/disable module&rdquo; fallback would be ignored.</p>
<p>Some fallback actions are defined using modifier keys (usually <code>ctrl +</code> and <code>shift +</code>). In this case you must define an initial shortcut without such a modifier in order to be able to use these fallbacks. For example, if you assign <code>ctrl + r</code> to an action, you cannot use a <code>ctrl +</code> fallback. Some default fallbacks of this type are provided for the <em>value</em> element and for horizontal/vertical movements in the (zoomed) central area &ndash; in this case, <code>shift +</code> increases the speed to 10.0 and <code>ctrl +</code> decreases the speed to 0.1.</p>
