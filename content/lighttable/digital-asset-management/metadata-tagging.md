darktable allows you to store additional information about your images to allow them to be more easily searched and grouped. This information is stored in darktable's database and XMP sidecar files and can also be included within exported images.

# metadata

Metadata (e.g. title, description) is free-format text that usually differs for each image. You can add metadata to images in the [metadata editor](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/metadata-editor.md) module.

# tagging

Tags are usually shared between multiple images and are used to categorise, group, and/or [sequence](../../lighttable/digital-asset-management/sequence.md) them. You can add tags to images in the [tagging](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/tagging.md) module.
