A collection is a group of images matching a given set of selection criteria.

The most basic kind of collection is a film roll, which contains all of the images that have been imported from a specific folder on disk -- whenever you [import](../../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import.md) images from the filesystem, those images are organized in a film roll whose name is derived from that of their parent folder.

You can easily construct other kinds of collection in the [collections](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/collections.md) module based on one or more image attributes (e.g. Exif data, filename, tags). The [collection filters](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/collection-filters.md) module allows you to refine a collection by setting additional selection and exclusion criteria.

A list of the most recently used collections is retained for quick access. These can be accessed from the [recent collections](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/recent-collections.md) module.
