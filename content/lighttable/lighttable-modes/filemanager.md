In the default mode images are displayed in a grid with an adjustable number of images per row.

# controls

zoom
: The number of images in each row can be altered using the numeric input in the bottom panel, or by holding Ctrl while scrolling over the center view with your mouse.

navigate
: You can navigate through the images using the arrow keys (←/→/↑/↓) or by scrolling with your mouse. Press the Home key to scroll to the top of the collection, the End key to scroll to the bottom, and PageUp/PageDown to scroll up/down by a page.

select
: You can select the image under the pointer by clicking on its thumbnail or by pressing Enter. To select a range of images, click on the first image and then Shift+click on the last one. To add or remove images in a selection, Ctrl+click on a thumbnail or hover over a thumbnail and press Spacebar.

hover
: When the pointer hovers over any image's thumbnail, it is highlighted and its image implicitly selected for keyboard shortcuts. If that thumbnail is part of a currently-selected set, certain shortcuts will be applied to _all_ images of the set (for example, a numeric digit star rating).

drag
: You can drag a thumbnail (**along with any selected set** to which it may belong) to set its [custom sort](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/collection-filters.md#custom-sort) position just before or after the image it's dropped upon.
