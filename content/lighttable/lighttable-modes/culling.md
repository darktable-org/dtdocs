Culling mode allows you to display images side by side for easy comparison.

# controls

zoom
: In culling mode, you can zoom into images (up to 100%) by holding Ctrl while scrolling with the mouse wheel.
: Pan within zoomed images with click+drag.
: By default, zooming and panning are synchronized between all visible images. If you want to zoom or pan only a specific image, add the Shift modifier to the above actions.

navigate
: Use the mouse wheel or arrow keys (←/→) to scroll through your collection.

# modes

There are two different culling modes, which define how many images are shown at the same time: “fixed” and “dynamic”. Switch between these while in culling mode by pressing the "<" key.

fixed mode
: The number of images displayed is always the same, independent of the selection length. This number can be set with a slider on the bottom panel.

: In this mode, you will navigate through all selected images. If no selection is set (or if only one image is selected), you will navigate through all images.

: The default keyboard shortcut to enter culling in fixed mode is X.

dynamic mode
: All of the selected images are shown. If no selection is set (or if only one image is selected) the last value from fixed mode is used.

: The default keyboard shortcut to enter culling in dynamic mode is Ctrl+X.

**Hint:** To enhance performance when loading zoomed images, you can enable ([preferences > lighttable > thumbnails > enable disk backend for full preview cache](../../preferences-settings/lighttable.md#thumbnails)). Bear in mind that this can occupy a lot of disk space.
