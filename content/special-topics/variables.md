darktable supports variable substitution in a number of modules and preference settings. For example:

- Defining file names in the [export](../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/export.md) module
- Displaying image information in the darkroom's [image information line](../module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/image-info-line.md)
- Displaying image information in the lighttable's overlays and tooltips (see [preferences > lighttable](../preferences-settings/lighttable.md))
- Placing text on an image in the [_watermark_](../module-reference/processing-modules/watermark.md) processing module

# string substitution

All of the variables support basic string substitution inspired by bash though some of the details differ. 

All patterns are treated as simple string comparisons. There is no regex support. 

The following string replacement functions are provided, where `var` is one of the variables listed above:

```
$(var-default)                   If var is empty, return "default"

$(var+alt_value)                 If var is set, return "alt_value" else return empty string

$(var:offset)                    Return var starting from offset 
                                 If offset is negative count from the end of the string

$(var:offset:length)             Starting from offset, return at most length characters of var
                                 If offset is negative the length is counted from the end of var
                                 If length is negative this indicates the end of the result, 
                                  counted from the end of var, and not an actual length

$(var#pattern)                   Remove "pattern" from the start of var 

$(var%pattern)                   Remove "pattern" from the end of var 

$(var/pattern/replacement)       Replace the first occurrence of "pattern" in var with "replacement"
                                 If "replacement" is empty then "pattern" will be removed

$(var//pattern/replacement)      Replace all occurrences of "pattern" in var with "replacement"
                                 If "replacement" is empty then "pattern" will be removed

$(var/#pattern/replacement)      If var starts with "pattern then "pattern" is replaced with "replacement" 

$(var/%pattern/replacement)      If var ends with "pattern" then "pattern" is replaced with "replacement" 

$(var^)                          Make the first character of var uppercase

$(var^^)                         Make all characters of var uppercase

$(var,)                          Make the first character of var lowercase

$(var,,)                         Make all characters of var lowercase
```
