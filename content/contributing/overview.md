This page defines the style guide for dtdocs and information about how to contribute to the project.

It is included in the user manual so that you can see how the page is rendered as well as how it is written. Please go to [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darktable-org/dtdocs/master/content/special-topics/contributing.md) to see the source for this page.

The manual structure and content have been carefully considered based on the following criteria:
1. The manual should be comprehensive -- it should describe all of the functionality available in darktable
1. It should have a consistent and logical structure and every piece of functionality should have its own logical place within that structure
1. It should be as long as necessary but as short as possible -- brevity is a must
1. It should be objective
1. Functionality should be explained once and only once (with the exception of the basic workflow guidelines in the overview section)
1. Images should be included only where necessary to improve understanding of key principles and should not contain text unless it is unavoidable

We are generally **not** interested in:
1. Restructuring the manual
1. Switching markup languages
1. Detailed workflow tutorials (though we are interested in publishing those on the blogs of either darktable.org or pixls.us)

We **are** interested in
1. Spelling and grammar corrections
1. Clarification of text
1. [Documentation for new features](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Adocumentation-pending+)

We are always extremely interested in hearing about which sections of the manual did not make sense to you and *why*, so that we can improve the documentation.

In general, if you wish to make a major change, please open an issue and discuss it with the maintainers first. This is to avoid doing work that wouldn't be accepted.

# modality

The preferred way is to create a pull request. See the [workflow](workflow.md) for a detailed step-by-step guide.

If you do not know what that is or don't feel comfortable doing it, feel free to suggest minor improvements to the docs by opening [a new issue](https://github.com/darktable-org/dtdocs/issues/new) on github.
