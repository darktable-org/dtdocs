**Please note that this module is [deprecated](../../darkroom/processing-modules/deprecated.md) from darktable 4.4 and should no longer be used for new edits. Please use the [_color balance rgb_](./color-balance-rgb.md) module instead.**

---

A very basic tool for adjusting the _contrast_, _brightness_ and _saturation_ of an image. Please note that a number of other modules provide much more versatile methods of adjusting these parameters.

All module controls default to a neutral position (zero) and provide the ability to increase or decrease the relevant parameter

---

_**Note:** This module works in Lab color space and is prone to halos. Instead, use the [color balance rgb](./color-balance-rgb.md) and [rgb levels](./rgb-levels.md) modules._  The gray control in _rgb levels_ is the same gamma adjustment that the _brightness_ control in this module applies.
