A fully-featured color-space correction, white balance adjustment and channel mixer. This simple yet powerful module can be used in the following ways:

- To adjust the white balance (chromatic adaptation), working in tandem with the [_white balance_](./white-balance.md) module. In this case, the _white balance_ module performs an initial white balance step (which is still required in order for the demosac module to work effectively). The _color calibration_ module then calculates a more accurate white balance after the input color profile has been applied.

- As a simple RGB channel mixer, adjusting the output R, G and B channels based on the R, G and B input channels. 

- To adjust the color saturation and brightness of the pixels, based on the relative strength of the R, G and B channels of each pixel.

- To produce a greyscale output based on the relative strengths of the R, G and B channels.

# Chromatic Adaptation Transformation (white balance)

Chromatic adaptation aims to predict how all surfaces in the scene would look if they had been lit by another illuminant. What we actually want to predict, though, is how those surfaces would have looked if they had been lit by the same illuminant as your monitor. White balance, on the other hand, aims only at ensuring that whites are really whites (R = G = B) and doesn’t really care about the rest of the color range.

Chromatic adaptation is controlled within the Chromatic Adaptation Transformation (CAT) tab of the _color calibration_ module. When used in this way the _white balance_ module only needs to perform a basic white balance operation assuming a D65 illuminant ("camera reference" mode). The remainder of the white balance (chromatic adaptation) is then performed by the _color calibration_ module. 

The _color calibration_ and _white balance_ modules can be automatically applied to achieve this for new edits by setting the chromatic adaptation workflow option ([`preferences > processing > auto-apply chromatic adaptation defaults`](../../preferences-settings/processing.md)) to "modern". If you prefer to perform all white balancing within the _white balance_ module, a "legacy" option is also available. Neither option precludes the use of other modules such as [_color balance_](./color-balance.md) further down the pixel pipeline for creative color grading.

By default, _color calibration_ will perform chromatic adaptation by:

- reading the raw EXIF to fetch the scene white balance set by the camera
- adjusting this setting with the reference white balance used in the white balance module
- further adjusting this setting with the input color profile in use (only the standard matrix)

It is also worth noting that, unlike the _white balance_ module, _color calibration_ can be used with [masks](../../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/_index.md). This means that you can selectively correct different parts of the image to account for differing light sources.

To achieve this, create an instance of the _color calibration_ module to perform global adjustments using a mask to exclude those parts of the image that you wish to handle differently. Then create a second instance of the module reusing the mask from the first instance (inverted) using a [raster mask](../../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/raster.md).

## CAT warnings

The chromatic adaptation in this module relies on a number of assumptions in order to work correctly and it can be easy to inadvertently break these assumptions in subtle ways. To help you to avoid these kind of mistakes, the _color calibration_ module will show warnings in the following circumstances.

- If the _color calibration_ module is set up to perform chromatic adaptation but the _white balance_ module is not set to "camera reference", warnings will be shown in both modules. These errors can be resolved either by setting the _white balance_ module to "camera reference" or by disabling chromatic adaptation in the _color balance_ module. Note that some sensors may require minor corrections within the _white balance_ module in which case these warnings can be ignored.

- If two or more instances of _color calibration_ have been created, each attempting to perform chromatic adaptation, an error will be shown on the second instance. This could be a valid use case (for instance where masks have been set up to apply different white balances to different non-overlapping areas of the image) in which case the warnings can be ignored. For most other cases, chromatic adaptation should be disabled in one of the instances to avoid double-corrections.

  By default, if an instance of the _color calibration_ module is already performing chromatic adaptation, each new instance you create will automatically have its adaptation set to "none (bypass)" to avoid this "double-correction" error.

The chromatic adaptation modes in _color balance_ can be disabled by either setting the _adaptation_ to "none (bypass)" or setting the _illuminant_ to "same as pipeline (D50)" in the CAT tab.

# channel mixing

The remainder of this module is a standard channel mixer, allowing you to adjust the output R, G, B, colorfulness, brightness and grey of the module based on the relative strengths of the R, G and B input channels.

Channel mixing is performed in the color space defined by the _adaptation_ control on the CAT tab. The _color calibration_ module can be made into a "pure" channel mixer (without chromatic adaptation) in pipeline RGB color space by setting the _adaptation_ to "none (bypass)". To perform channel mixing in one of the _adaptation_ color spaces without chromatic adaptation, set the _illuminant_ to "same as pipeline (D50)".

The following diagram illustrates how the R, G and B input channels are mixed together using different sliders to produce R, G and B output channels. For example, the R output channel is normally dependant mainly on the R input channel, but some cross-talk from the G and B channels can also be mixed in.

![channel-mixer](color-calibration/channelmixer.png#w100)

Another way to think of channel mixing is that is it rotating and scaling the vectors representing the R, G and B primary colors within the standard CIE XYZ color space reference frame. By shifting the primary colors around, it will shift the hues of the colors within the image, which can be useful for creative purposes.

## RGB matrix multiplication

At its most basic level, you can think of the R, G and B tabs of the _color calibration_ module as a type of matrix multiplication between a 3x3 matrix and the input [R G B] values. This is in fact very similar to what a matrix-based ICC color profile does, except that the user can input the matrix coefficients via the darktable GUI rather than reading the coefficients from a file.

```
┌ R_out ┐     ┌ Rr Rg Rb ┐     ┌ R_in ┐
│ G_out │  =  │ Gr Gg Gb │  X  │ G_in │
└ B_out ┘     └ Br Bg Bb ┘     └ B_in ┘
```

If, for example, you've been provided with a matrix to transform from one color space to another, you can enter the matrix coefficients into the _channel mixer_ as follows:

- select the _red_ tab and then set the Rr, Rg & Rb values using the red, green and blue input sliders
- select the _green_ tab and then set the Gr, Gg & Gb values using the red, green and blue input sliders
- select the _blue_ tab and then set the Br, Bg & Bb values using the red, green and blue input sliders

By default, the mixing function in _color calibration_ just copies the input [R G B] channels straight over to the matching output channels. This is equivalent to multiplying by the identify matrix:

```
┌ R_out ┐     ┌ 1  0  0 ┐      ┌ R_in ┐
│ G_out │  =  │ 0  1  0 │   X  │ G_in │
└ B_out ┘     └ 0  0  1 ┘      └ B_in ┘
```

To get an intuitive understanding of how the mixing sliders on the red, greeen and blue tabs behave:

- for the _red_ destination, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more red. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more cyan.
- for the _green_ destination, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more green. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more magenta.
- for the _blue_ destination, adjusting sliders to the right will make the R, G or B areas of the image more blue. Moving the slider to the left will make those areas more yellow.

## brightness and colorfulness adjustments

The brightness and colorfulness (color saturation) of pixels in an image can also be adjusted based on the R, G and B input channels. This uses the same basic algorithm that the [_filmic rgb_](filmic-rgb.md) module uses for tone mapping (which preserves RGB ratios) and for midtones saturation (which massages them). 

For example, if you want to darken the pixels that have a high blue component and brighten those having a high red component, you can do this by decreasing the blue slider and increasing the red slider on the brightness tab. Similarly, on the colorfulness tab, you can influence the overall color saturation of individual pixels based on how much of one component or another each pixel has.

## monochrome output

Another very useful application of _color calibration_ is the ability to mix the channels together to produce a greyscale output -- a monochrome image. Select the _grey_ tab, and set the red, green and blue sliders to control how much each 
channel contributes to the brightness of the output. This is equivalent to the following matrix multiplication:
```
GRAY_out  =   [ r  g  b ]  X  ┌ R_in ┐
                              │ G_in │
                              └ B_in ┘
```

When dealing with skin tones, the relative weights of the three channels will affect the level of detail in the image. Placing more weight on red (e.g. `[0.9, 0.3, -0.3]`) will make for smooth skin tones, whereas emphasising green (e.g. `[0.4, 0
.75, -0.15]`) will bring out more detail. In both cases the blue channel is reduced to avoid emphasising unwanted skin texture.

# module controls

## CAT tab

Control the working color space of the module and optionally perform chromatic adaptation.

adaptation
: The working color space in which the module will perform its chromatic adaptation transform and channel mixing. The following options are provided:

: - _Linear Bradford (1985)_: This is more accurate for illuminants close to daylight but produces out-of-gamut colors for more difficult illuminants.
: - _CAT16 (2016)_: This is more robust in avoiding imaginary colors while working with large gamut or saturated cyan and purple.
: - _Non-linear Bradford (1985)_: This can produce better results than the linear version but is unreliable.
: - _XYZ_: A simple scaling space (scaled by luminance Y). This is generally not recommended except for testing and debugging purposes.
: - _none (disable)_: Disable any adaptation and use the pipeline working RGB space.

illuminant
: The type of illuminant assumed to have lit the scene. Choose from the following:

: - _same as pipeline (D50)_: Do not perform chromatic adaptation in this module instance but perform channel mixing using the selected _adaptation_ color space.
: - _CIE standard illuminant_: Choose from one of the CIE standard illuminants (daylight, incandescent, fluorescent, equi-energy, or black body), or a non-standard "LED light" illuminant. These values are all pre-computed -- as long as your camera sensor is properly profiled, you can just use them as-is. For illuminants that lie near the Planckian locus, an additional "temperature" control is also provided (see below).
: - _custom_: If a neutral grey patch is available in the image, the color of the illuminant can be selected using the color picker, or can be manually specified using hue and saturation sliders (in LCh perceptual color space). The color swatch next to the color picker shows the color of the calculated illuminant used in the CAT compensation. The color picker can also be used to restrict the area used for AI detection (below).
: - _(AI) detect from image surfaces_: This algorithm obtains the average color of image patches that have a high covariance between chroma channels in YUV space and a high intra-channel variance. In other words, it looks for parts of the image that appear as though they should be grey, and discards flat colored surfaces that may be legitimately non-grey. It also discards chroma noise as well as chromatic aberrations.
: - _(AI) detect from image edges_: Unlike the _white balance_ module's auto-white-balancing which relies on the "grey world" assumption, this method auto-detects a suitable illuminant using the "grey edge" assumption, by calculating the Minkowski p-norm (p = 8) of the laplacian and trying to minimize it. That is to say, it assumes that edges should have the same gradient over all channels (grey edges). It is more sensitive to noise than the previous surface-based detection method.
: - _as shot in camera_: Calculate the illuminant based on the white balance settings provided by the camera.

temperature
: Adjust the color temperature of the illuminant. Move the slider to the right to assume a more blue illuminant, which will make the white-balanced picture appear warmer/more red. Move the slider to the left to assume a more red illuminant, which makes the image appear cooler/more blue after compensation. 

: This control is only provided for illuminants that lie near the Planckian locus and provides fine-adjustment along that locus. For other illuminants the concept of "color temperature" doesn't make sense, so no temperature slider is provided. 

hue
: For custom white balance, set the _hue_ of the illuminant color in LCh color space.

chroma
: For custom white balance, set the _chroma_ (or saturation) of the illuminant color in LCh color space.

gamut compression
:  When performing chromatic adaptation, colors in the image can be pushed out of gamut (that is, it may no longer be possible to represent certain colors as a valid [R,G,B] triplet with positive values in the working color space). By using a combination of _gamut compression_ (which uses XYZ scaling) and _negative RGB vaue clipping_, the colors can be squeezed back into gamut, albeit with some loss of hue accuracy. One example where this feature is very useful is for scenes where there are blue LED lights, which are often quite problematic and result in ugly gamut clipping in the final image.

clip negative RGB from gamut
: Remove any negative RGB values (set them to zero).

## R, G and B tabs

These tabs allow the R, G and B output channels for each pixel to be calculated using a weighted sum of the R, G and B input channels. Each tab has 3 sliders, and there are 3 tabs, so the sliders are effectively setting the coefficients of a 3x3 matrix, as described above.

input red/green/blue
: Choose how much the input R, G and B channels influence the output channel relating to the tab concerned.

normalize channels
: Select this checkbox to normalize the coefficients to try to preserve the overall brightness of this channel in the final image as compared to the input image. 

## colorfulness tab

input red/green/blue
: Adjust the color saturation of pixels, based on the R, G and B channels of those pixels. For example, adjusting the _input red_ slider will affect the color saturation of pixels containing a lot of red more than colors containing only a small amount of red. 

normalize channels
: Select this checkbox to try to keep the overall saturation constant between the input and output images.

## brightness tab

input red/green/blue
: Adjust the brightness of certain colors in the image, based on the R, G and B channels of those colors. For example, adjusting the _input red_ slider will affect the brightness of colors containing a lot of R channel much more than colors containing only a small amount of R channel. When darkening/brightening a pixel, the ratio of the R, G and B channels for that pixel is maintained, in order to preserve the hue.

normalize channels
: Select this checkbox to try to keep the overall brightness constant between the input and output images.

## grey tab

This tab allows you to convert a color image into a greyscale image using the relative strengths of the R, G and B channels. 

input red/green/blue
: Choose how much each of the R, G and B channels contribute to the grey level of the output. The image will only be converted to monochrome if the three sliders add up to some non-zero value. Adding more blue will tend to bring out more details, adding more red will tend to smooth skin tones.

normalize channels
: Select this checkbox to try to keep the overall brightness constant as the sliders are adjusted.
