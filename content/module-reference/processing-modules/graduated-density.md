Simulate a graduated density filter in order to correct exposure and color in a progressive manner.

A line is shown on screen allowing the position and rotation of the gradient to be modified with the mouse.

This module is known to provoke banding artifacts under certain conditions. You should consider activating the [_dither and posterize_](./dithering.md) module to alleviate these issues.

# module controls

density
: Set the density of the filter (EV). A low value underexposes slightly whereas a high value creates a strong filter.

hardness
: The progressiveness of the gradient. A low value creates a smooth transition, whereas a high value makes the transition more abrupt.

rotation
: The rotation of the filter. Negative values rotate clockwise. The rotation can also be set by dragging the end of the gradient line with the mouse.

hue
: Choose a hue to add a color cast to the gradient.

saturation
: The saturation of the color cast to add to the gradient (defaults to a neutral color cast of 0)
