Create a soft bloom effect. 

This module works by blurring the highlights and then blending the result with the original image.

---

_**Note:** This module performs blurs in Lab color space, and is no longer recommended. Instead, use the [tone equalizer](./tone-equalizer.md) module or the [exposure](./exposure.md) module with a [parametric mask](../../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric.md)._
