An artistic feature to create a softened image using the Orton effect.

Michael Orton achieved his results on slide film by using two exposures of the same scene, one well exposed and one overexposed. He then used a darkroom technique to blend these two images into a final image where the overexposed image was blurred.

This module is a near-copy of Orton's analogue process into the digital domain.

## Module Controls

size
: The size of blur of the overexposed image, the bigger the size, the softer the result.

saturation
: The saturation of the overexposed image

brightness
: The brightness (EV) of the overexposed image

mix
: How the two images are mixed. 50% represents an equal mix of the well exposed and overexposed images.
