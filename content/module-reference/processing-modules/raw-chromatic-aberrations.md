Correct chromatic aberrations of raw images.

This module currently only works for raw images recorded with a Bayer sensor (the sensor used in the majority of cameras) -- for other types of image, you should use the [_chromatic aberrations_](./chromatic-aberrations.md) module instead.

The module will also not apply any corrections to any photos that have been identified as monochrome (see [developing monochrome images](../../guides-tutorials/monochrome.md) for more information).

This module expects good white balance data provided by the [_white balance_](./white-balance.md) module for best results, in most cases it's _default_ settings are sufficient.

Note that if this module is enabled, then TCA correction in the [_lens correction_](./lens-correction.md) module should be disabled, as the two modules will conflict with one another.

# module controls

iterations
: The number of iterations. For most images, "twice" is sufficient, and is the default value. Occasionally, increasing this control can give better results.

avoid colorshift
: If the module causes tinting - often pink or greenish - tick this box to apply a correction.
