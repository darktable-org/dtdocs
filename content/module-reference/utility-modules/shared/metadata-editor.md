The “preferences…” option in the presets menu brings up a dialog where you can configure how metadata is handled within darktable. For each metadata item, two check boxes allow you to restrict how metadata is handled:

: Show or hide this metadata field. Hidden fields are not included in exported images.

private
: Keep this metadata field private. Private fields are not included in exported images.
