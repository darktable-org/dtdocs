Search for a location on the map. You must be connected to the internet to use this feature.

To use this module, type in a place name or address, press Enter and a list of results will be shown. Click on an item in the list and the map will zoom to that location. An outline covering that location or a pin pointing at the location will be displayed.

An outline (polygon) can be used to create a user location. Check the _max polygon points_ parameter in the [map settings](./map-settings.md) module to ensure that sufficient points are available for a polygon to be displayed.
