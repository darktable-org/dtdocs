View your image rendered using a selected color profile.

Click the ![soft proof](./soft-proof/soft-proof-icon.png#icon) icon to activate the soft proof display mode on your image. This allows you to preview your image rendered using a printer profile to see how colors will end up on the final print. You can also activate soft proof with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S. A message “soft proof" on the bottom left of your image tells you that you are in soft proof display mode.

Right-click on the icon to open a dialog with the following configuration parameters. For each of these parameters, the list of available profiles is read from `$DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/out` and `$HOME/.config/darktable/color/out` (where `$DARKTABLE` represents darktable's installation directory and `$HOME` your home directory). Note that these `color/out` directories are not created by the darktable install; if you need to use one, you must create it yourself.

display profile
: Set the color profile for the display. The option “system display profile” is the preferred setting when working with a calibrated display. The profile is taken either from your system's color manager or from your X display server. The method darktable uses to detect your system display profile can be changed in [preferences > miscellaneous](../../../preferences-settings/miscellaneous.md). For more information see the [display profile](../../../special-topics/color-management/display-profile.md) section.

preview display profile
: Set the color profile for the preview image if you are using a second window.

intent
: Set the rendering intent for your display -- only available if rendering with LittleCMS2 is activated. See [rendering intent](../../../special-topics/color-management/rendering-intent.md) for a list of available options. This option appears twice -- once for the "display profile" and once for the "preview display profile".

softproof profile
: Set the color profile for soft proofing. Typically these profiles are supplied by your printer or generated during printer profiling.

histogram profile
: Set the color profile of the histogram. None of the available options are ideal, however, "system display profile" is probably the _least bad_ setting, since all other profiles are derived from the display color space and at least the values will conform to what you see on screen.
