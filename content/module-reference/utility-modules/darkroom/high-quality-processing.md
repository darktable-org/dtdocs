Process the image in the darkroom view using "high quality mode", so that the displayed image reflects the appearance of a full-sized export.

Activate this mode by clicking the ![high quality processing icon](./high-quality-processing/high-quality-processing-icon.png#icon) icon at the bottom of the darkroom view.

Note that while this mode provides the most accurate representation of the processed image, it also results in significant performance degradation. Please see the [types of pixelpipe](../../../darkroom/pixelpipe/the-pixelpipe-and-module-order.md#types-of-pixelpipe) section for a full discussion.
