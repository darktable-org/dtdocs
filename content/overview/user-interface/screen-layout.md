The layout of all views is similar and consists of a center area with panels at the edges: 

![screen-layout](./screen-layout/screen-layout.png#w100)

center area
: Contains information and functionality specific to the current view.

left panel
: Contains modules primarily used to provide information.

right panel
: Contains modules primarily used for image processing.

top banner
: Contains information about the current darktable version and allows you to switch between views. Also used by some modules to show hints and messages.

[top panel](./top-panel.md)
: Provides access to global settings and shortcuts

bottom panel
: Provides access to view-specific settings and shortcuts.

[filmstrip](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/filmstrip.md)/[timeline](../../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/timeline.md) panel
: An optional panel that can be enabled at the bottom of the screen to display a timeline (in the lighttable view) or a filmstrip (in other views) of images in the current collection.

# panel size and visibility

The left, right and filmstrip/timeline panels can be resized by dragging their inner borders. 

Each of the panels can be expanded or collapsed by pressing a triangle located at the outside edge of the panel. Panel visibility can also be adjusted using keyboard shortcuts, as follows:

```
TAB             Temporarily expand the centre view to fill the whole window. 
                Press again to return to the previous view.
F11             Toggle fullscreen mode
Shift+Ctrl+t    Toggle the top panel (between the image and the top banner)
Shift+Ctrl+b    Toggle the bottom panel (beween the image and the filmstrip/timeline if shown)
Shift+Ctrl+l    Toggle the left panel
Shift+Ctrl+r    Toggle the right panel
Ctrl+f          Toggle the filmstrip/timeline
Ctrl+h          Toggle the top banner
b               Toggle all borders and panel-collapse controls
```
