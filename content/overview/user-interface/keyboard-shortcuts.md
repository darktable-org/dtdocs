Much of the functionality in darktable can be controlled via keyboard shortcuts which can be customised in [`preferences > shortcuts`](../../preferences-settings/shortcuts.md).

Press the `H` button (for help) in any darktable view to show a list of all shortcuts that are applicable to the current view.
