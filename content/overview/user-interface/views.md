There are five different views available in darktable:

: Manage images and collections.

[darkroom](../../darkroom/_index.md)
: Develop a single image.

[map](../../map/_index.md)
: Show images with a geo-tag data on a map and manually geo-tag new images.

[print](../../print/_index.md)
: Send images to your printer.

[slideshow](../../slideshow/_index.md)
: Display images as a slideshow, processing them on-the-fly.

[tethering](../../tethering/_index.md)
: Remotely capture and save images taken with a connected camera.

```
L 	switch to lighttable
D 	switch to darkroom
