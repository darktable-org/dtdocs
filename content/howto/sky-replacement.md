To replace the sky in an image, you will first need another picture of
just sky with the appearance you like.  Ensure that the image has been
[imported](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import.md)
into your library.

On the image whose sky you want to replace, open the
[_composite_](../module-reference/processing-modules/composite.md)
module and drag your sky image from the filmstrip into the module.

Turn on [parametric](../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric.md)
or [drawn and parametric](../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn-and-parametric.md)
masking, then use color and lightness to select the sky and optionally
a drawn mask to exclude any areas which can't be excluded without
losing a portion of the sky.
