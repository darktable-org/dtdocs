Images taken with an anamorphic lens will have a different pixel
aspect ratio than the scene which was photographed.  To restore the
correct appearance, use the
[_rotate and perspective_](../module-reference/processing-modules/rotate-perspective.md)
module - select "specific" for _lens model_ and then enter the aspect
ratio of the lens for _aspect adjust_.
