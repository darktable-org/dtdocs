To open shadows or improve details in highlights, use the
[_tone equalizer_](../module-reference/processing-modules/tone-equalizer.md).

On its _masking_ tab, click the two magic wands, and fine-tune the
mask brightness with the _mask exposure compensation_ and _mask
contrast compensation_ sliders.  Then move your mouse over areas of
the image you want to adjust and scroll to brighten or darken areas of
the image with that brightness.
