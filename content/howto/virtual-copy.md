darktable calls multiple developments of a single image "duplicates".  You
can create, remove, or name them using the
_duplicate manager_](../module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/duplicate-manager.md)
in [_darkroom_](../darkroom/darkroom-view-layout.md) view, and you can
create duplicates by selecting one or more images in the lighttable
and clicking on the _duplicate_ button in the
[_actions on selection_](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/selected-image.md)
module.
