Most actions done in [lightable view](../lighttable/undo-redo.md) can
be reversed with the standard Ctrl-Z shortcut key and reapplied with
Ctrl-Y.

In darkroom view, you can either use
[Ctrl-Z](../darkroom/pixelpipe/undo-redo.md) to undo actions one step
at a time, or you can click on an item in the
[_history stack_](../module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/history-stack.md)
module to reset the edit state to what it was when that item was added to
the stack.  You can freely jump between different positions in the
history as long as you do not change settings in any of the
[processing modules](../module-reference/processing-modules/_index.md).
