To apply the same edit to multiple photos, you can

- use a [style](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles.md)

- edit one photo and then [copy and paste](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/history-stack.md)
  the edits onto others

See also the [tutorial](../guides-tutorials/batch-editing.md).
