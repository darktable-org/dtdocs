Most of the automatically-applied edits you see in the
[_darkroom_](../darkroom.md) view when opening an image are required
to display your raw file _at all_.  Other software applies equivalent
edits, but doesn't tell you about it.

Operations shown with a dot-inside-a-circle can not be turned off,
because without them there is no image (a raw file is just a pile of
sensor readings).

Others which show with the usual power-button icon can be turned off,
but are needed to have a _useful_ image display.  Automatic addition
of the _color calibration_ and _filmic rgb_ or _sigmoid_ modules can
be disabled by adjusting the auto-applied workflow defaults in the
[_processing_](../preferences-settings/processing.md) tab of the
_global preferences_ dialog.
