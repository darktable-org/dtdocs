What other programs call clarity is an adjustment of local contrast.
You can do this in darktable with the
[_local contrast_](../module-reference/processing-modules/local-contrast.md)
module (on the [_Quick Access Panel_](../darkroom/organization/quick-access-panel.md)
by default) or by starting with the "clarity" preset in the
[_contrast equalizer_](../module-reference/processing-modules/contrast-equalizer.md)
module (quite strong) or one of the "local contrast" presets in the
[_diffuse and sharpen_](../module-reference/processing-modules/diffuse.md)
module (generally very subtle).
