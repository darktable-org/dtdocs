darktable does not have radial gradients, but you can get a very similar effect by
[_masking_](../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn.md)
with a circle or ellipse which you adjust to a very small size with a
very large feather to get a gradual drop-off in intensity in all
directions from a central point.

It is also possible to curve a gradient mask, but this is more
appropriate for matching a curved line in the image than for emulating
a point source for an effect.
