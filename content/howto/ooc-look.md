By default, darktable displays your raw images with minimal processing -
just enough to get a displayable image (for unedited images, the
lighttable thumbnail can be the embedded preview JPEG generated by the
camera using the manufacturer's own algorithms).

As of version 5.0, darktable ships with custom styles to make images
from most supported camera models look more like the camera
manufacturer's processing.  You can apply these manually or
automatically on import.

For automatic application, install and activate the
`apply_camera_style` Lua script in the [script
installer](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/lua-scripts-installer.md).
You can also use this script to apply the appropriate style to a
selection of images which have already been imported.

For manual application, open the
[_styles_](../../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/styles.md)
module and navigate to the `darktable camera styles` entry in the list
of styles.  Expand this entry to show camera manufacturers, then
expand the appropriate manufacturer to access its models.  Note that
applying a different model's style to your camera's images is unlikely
to make them look like JPEGs from the other model, but may still yield
interesting results.
