The slideshow view is still in an early stage of development with only a basic set of features.

If you don't need the auto-advance mode, you could even use the [sticky-preview feature](../lighttable/lighttable-modes/full-preview.md) instead.

```

spacebar             start and stop auto-advance mode which automatically switches
                     to the next images every five seconds by default.

ESC                  leave slideshow mode and return to lighttable view.


right arrow          switch to the next image of the collection.
or left-click

left arrow or        switch to the previous image of the collection.
right-click

up arrow             increase delay between each image.


down arrow           decrease delay between each image.


```

**Hint:** To take full advantage of your screen size, put darktable into fullscreen mode by pressing `F11` and hide the border-controls by pressing the key `b`.
