This view allows you to select and print your images.

The first step is to select an image in the [lighttable view](../lighttable/_index.md), then switch to the print view. The selected image will be displayed in the centre panel and the [print settings](../module-reference/utility-modules/print/print-settings.md) module will now allow you to adjust printer settings and initiate printing.

The [filmstrip](../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/filmstrip.md) at the bottom of the screen is active and you can select more images into the centre panel ready for printing.
